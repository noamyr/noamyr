All we want you to do is to enjoy the advertisements that are communicated by the food. Dishes of food are constantly streamed on a rotating conveyor belt. Pick up what you want and eat. Continue this till you’re full. Our foods are specifically designed to provide an eating experience as a media for the advertisements. From the food that you choose, our AI waiting-staff will analyze your preference, class, gender, purchasing power, political leaning, etc into more than 300 specific categories. The conveyor belt will be restored with new dishes based on our analysis to suit your interest perfectly."

        <div class="item w"><div><p class="body">Ristorante di Attenzione is a provocative restaurant that demonstrates how attention economy functions. It’s also an experimental tool to research the influence of attention economy that became more pervasive in everyday life.

        <div class="item n"><div><p class="body">Taste is the most individualized sense. If one has to compare the number of people that they’ve seen with the number of people that they’ve tasted, this becomes very apparent. Advertisements and propaganda used to deal with the mass audience, but it started to realized the importance of a personalized experience. I believe it’s inevitable for the advertisers to use food as a media someday.</p></div></div>

        <div class="item n"><div><p class="body">Ristorante di Attenzione was performed at DENF coffee Eindhoven during the Dutch Design Week. The conversations between a performer an the visitors were edited into a 15-minute film, which is a combination of design-fiction and public-interviews.
