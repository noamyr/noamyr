            <p>Interdisciplinary queer designer Noam Youngrak Son presents a hybrid storytelling workshop with Sonic
                Acts. Taking inspiration from the complex and enduringly obscure reproductive cycle of eels, the
                workshop involves collaborative and generative writing processes, with participants producing short
                stories about water that will be combined into a riso-printed zine.</p>

            <p>Eels have sex in such an obscure way that no human has ever witnessed their spawning behaviours in
                nature. Unlike the linear, fragmented, aimlessly extending routes of humans, eels have drawn numerous
                circular paths overlapping, over generations, accumulating stories in their cells. The aquatic
                intercourse of eels resembles the collective process of writing that will take place in this workshop.
                Led by Noam Youngrak Son, an interdisciplinary queer designer, ‘The story-telling eel-orgy’ is a
                workshop that turns its participants into freshwater eels gathered in the Sargasso Sea to procreate. As
                sexually aroused eels, every participant in the workshop will produce short stories packed in
                ‘reproductive cells’, based on their lived (or fictional) experiences around water.</p>
            <p>In the workshop, the process of blending bodily histories will be demonstrated using a simple algorithm
                called a Markov Chain, a model ‘describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of
                each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event’. Applied to generative writing, a
                Markov chain can be used to find the most probable phrase that will come after a specific phrase—in
                other words, an endless stream of text starting from the first word. The short stories created by
                participants will become the source materials for the algorithm to construct hybrid myths, like infant
                eels emerging from the Sargasso Sea. The ‘offspring’ will be published into riso-printed zines at the
                end of the workshop, which all participants will get to take home.</p>

            <p>Noam Youngrak Son is a communication designer, design theorist, and cultural worker. Their design
                work encompasses small-scale publishing projects, speculative worldbuilding, workshops, lectures,
                writing, net art, and
                occasional performative interventions. As a cultural worker, they have co-organized the Ghent-based
                queer publishing collective <a href="https://bebebooks.be" target="_blank">Bebe Books</a> since 2021.
                Son has expanded their focus from design to
                <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hBTyPORE_YEFztVhoPBXjRIsWXqfQjr7/view?usp=sharing"
                    target="_blank">theory</a> in order to critically engage with the ontology of the design industry,
                media, and broader
                material culture. This turn is informed by their observations of cultural assemblages that echo the
                extractive operations of capitalism on racialized and more-than-human populations. They are
                particularly attentive to the interconnected notions of speculation—both as an open artistic
                approach and as a process of value increase in capitalism. They research the tendency of the former
                in design to be subjugated by the latter and explore alternative methods for speculative design
                practices to realize their transindividual potential through collective organization and workshop
                facilitation. In this process, Son utilizes queer publishing as a technology for mobilizing
                attention beyond the financialized “scarce resource” of the attention economy. In this context,
                publishing extends beyond mere printed matter to encompass the maintenance of communities and the
                cultivation of interspecies relationships. The term "queer" here is not used as a statement of
                identity but as a process—small yet collective strategies of publishing that challenge the modern
                myth of the heroic designer.
