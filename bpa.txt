The toilet paper poem

*Some thermal papers are coated with BPA.BPA is a xenoestrogen, exhibiting hormone-like properties that mimic the effects of estrogen in the body.

A roll of thermal paper almost resembles toilet paper. 
Rub your dirty orifice with this poem. Wipe your tears with this paper. 
Xenoestrogen, the other name for Bisphenol A, will permeate through the anal membrane, mingle with your estrogen receptor, and disrupt your endocrine system. Let it queer you, make you infertile, decouple your intercourse with gestation, obscure your way between binary bathroom doors.

Then flush this poem into the toilet bowl, dissolve the hormone into the water.
The gay liquid swirls, drips, flows, overflows, evaporates, rains, freezes, and snows through the plumbing system. When a sea slug, an oyster, a frog, or a penguin drinks this, they will soon discover gay joy. When this flows through a shower head, water faucet, or toilet tank, let’s wish it will fuck up the oppressive infrastructure of pee-pee-poo-poo, so fucked up that it uncasterates our revolutionary anus while turning cis-heteronormative capitalism infertile.

Some thermal papers are coated with BPA, a chemical considered to be an endocrine disruptor. BPA can transfer readily to the skin in small amounts. BPA is a xenoestrogen, exhibiting hormone-like properties that mimic the effects of estrogen in the body. Xenoestrogens are a type of xenohormone that imitates estrogen. They can be either synthetic or natural chemical compounds. Synthetic xenoestrogens include some widely used industrial compounds which have estrogenic effects on a living organism even though they differ chemically from the estrogenic substances produced internally by the endocrine system of any organism. Natural xenoestrogens include phytoestrogens which are plant-derived xenoestrogens. Because the primary route of exposure to these compounds is by consumption of phytoestrogenic plants, they are sometimes called “dietary estrogens”. Mycoestrogens, estrogenic substances from fungi, are another type of xenoestrogen that are also considered mycotoxins. Xenoestrogens are clinically significant because they can mimic the effects of endogenous estrogen and thus have been implicated in precocious puberty and other disorders of the reproductive system.Xenoestrogens include pharmacological estrogens (in which estrogenic action is an intended effect, as in the drug ethinylestradiol used in contraceptive pills), but other chemicals may also have estrogenic effects. Xenoestrogens have been introduced into the environment by industrial, agricultural and chemical companies and consumers only in the last 70 years or so, but archiestrogens exist naturally. Some plants (like the cereals and the legumes) are using estrogenic substances possibly as part of their natural defence against herbivore animals by controlling their fertility.
