        <p>From the shadow banning on Instagram to the cancellation of pro-Palestinian cultural workers in the German (and more broadly, Western) cultural sector, words and images against the ongoing genocide in Gaza are being censored. This webpage was created in response to this political status quo, which FÃ©lix Gonzalez-Torres described as <a href="https://www.felixgonzalez-torresfoundation.org/works/forbidden-colors">'forbidden colors'</a> in his 1988 painting.
        </p>
        <p>I offer this webpage as a simple resource through which these forbidden colors could be represented in your image with more ease by converting every pixel in the uploaded image into one of the forbidden colors. This is not a mere aesthetic gesture but a practical tool. Please use this for the following purposes:
        </p>
        <p>
        <ul><li>For any visual material created to support Palestine against the Israel Occupation Forces.</li>
            <li>To express solidarity with Palestine in your images, particularly in contexts (like Instagram) where direct mentions of Palestine, related terms and uses of its flag may be algorithmically censored.</li>
            <li>To adapt your image for risograph printing using red, green, and black drums, especially for printed publications about Palestine.
            And for any other purpose against racial capitalism that you might find relevant.</li>
        </ul>
