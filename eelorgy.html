        <div class="item n"><div><p class="body">Close your eyes and open it again. You are a freshwater eel who just returned to the Sargasso Sea to have sex and die. Your life also initiated here, and you were tiny and transparent when you were freshly born. You migrated to Europe and spent most of your life there. As you grew old, your body became bigger and darker and morphed drastically, yet your genitals were still undifferentiated. You stayed sexually immature until you decide to leave where you settled and go back to where you were born. There was even an eel who wasn’t able to proceed its travel by being trapped in a well and lived more than 150 years in a juvenile state. Nobody still doesn’t understand what exactly triggers you to feel an urge to start this journey. 
            <br><br>
        Reading the moon, smelling the water, feeling the ocean currents, and sensing Earth’s magnetic field, you navigate in the vast ocean. This is an extremely dangerous path that only a small number of eels eventually accomplish. The travel changes the structure of your eyes to see the color of the deeper water and makes your genitals ready for intercourse. And now you’re here at the very last moment of your eel-life.

            <h2 class="subtitle">Here are some practical tips for my fellow eels in the orgy:</h2> 
            <p class="body">
                <br>
            &#128166; Each cell can contain a Twitter-length (280 characters) story. 
            <br>
            &#128166; For more successful reproduction, it’s important to have as many sperms and eggs as possible. Please keep in mind that all the stories should be written in the first-organism perspective with the pronoun ‘I’ because your reproductive cell is a personal reservoir of your bodily stories.
            <br>
            &#128166; Your stories can be in any written form as long as it doesn’t exceed the character limit: Fiction/Nonfiction, Prose/Poetry, Serious/Nonsensical. Using English is recommended for the ease of communication in the workshop, however, you can use any language and writing system as long as it’s represented in Unicode. Using text in a non-lingual way, such as ASCII art is also possible.
            <br>
            &#128166; The process of mixing cells will be demonstrated using a simple algorithm called a Markov Chain, a model ‘describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event’. Applied to generative writing, a Markov chain can be used to find the most probable phrase that will come after a specific phrase—in other words, an endless stream of text starting from the first word. Your stories will be shredded and reassembled into hybrid myths, like infant eels emerging from the Sargasso Sea.
