  <h1>Why am I presenting an autobiographical work?</h1>
  <p>Dear friends and comrades,<br>This talk is an autobiographical work, an art form that I have been resisting for years. To be more precise, I am
    critical of the systemic encouragement of autobiographical work in Dutch design schools and its popularization in
    adjacent design sectors.<br>
    I am talking about design because it is the field I am most familiar with, and perhaps this is an invitation for you
    to critically reflect on the abundance of certain forms of practice in the environments you’re more engaged with,
    such as riso-printed zines, artist collectives, bioart, and monstera plants.
  </p>
  <p>My criticism of the abundance of autobiographical design works is based on my observation of the apparatus of Dutch
    Design operating as the attention economy.<br>
    Their famous design week, for example, is, in its essence, the apparatus of algorithmic culture, the media platforms
    through which images and narratives are distributed, almost exactly like YouTube and Instagram, making the vast
    number of projects compete over 'attention' as a scarce resource.

  </p>
  <p>One of the symptoms of the attention economy is the shadow ban, the practice of blocking a user and their content
    from an online community in such a way that the ban is not readily apparent to the user, like how the content on
    Instagram about the ongoing genocide in Gaza is treated. This is pretty much what happened at the Dutch Design Week
    this year because I could not find any statements or content about Palestine there, as if it’s pretending this issue
    is too trivial for what they call transformative design. However, I am pretty sure that in a few years, these
    hypocrites calling themselves professional optimists will add price tags to this issue they ignored today.
  </p>
  <p>Another aspect of Dutch design as the attention economy that I would like to highlight in relation to
    autobiographical work is that the attention economy gives a false impression to its users that they’re the agents
    when they’re actually the products. This is where my critique of the popularity of autobiographical design
    originates. For the apparatus of Dutch design, the encouragement of autobiographical design is a strategy of
    commodification, turning its constituents who believe they’re designers into commodities.<br>
    For example, when it comes to the famous graduation show of Design Academy Eindhoven, a significant part of its
    reputation originates from the diversity of the students it represents, coming “from over 40 different countries” as
    indicated proudly on the school’s website. Therefore, what often happens in such an environment is the unmediated
    encouragement to make student works self-referential. And this pressure, of course, becomes more explicit when you
    look exotic, and I remember my classmates being asked by their tutors, “Oh, why don’t you work on something related
    to the politics in Lebanon?”, “Why don’t you make something about the yellow vest movement (probably because she was
    a working-class person of color from France)?”<br>
    We all know that the personal is political, but if the demand for the personal is fueled by the fetishizing gaze of
    an institution, the personal gets detached from the political and remains as an objectified individual.
  </p>
  <p>My partner once described my perspective represented in my graduation work from Design Academy Eindhoven as that of
    a formless floating blobby head, and I couldn’t disagree. And later I realized that it was my strategy against
    conforming to the institutional demand for an autobiographical work.<br>
    I am not sure how effective this tactic was, yet the only thing I’m certain about is that I am no longer friends
    with the “straight artist” who called my occupation “nonbinary designer” in the introduction of her publication that
    I participated in.
  </p>
  <p class="highlight">But here, I am comfortable presenting an autobiographical work because, thankfully, my position in this environment
    is not as a freelance worker who has to provide “entertainment services,” and I believe, throughout the year, DAI as
    a community has earned my trust so that I can afford to be more genuine. I hope you enjoy this sincerity but don’t
    take it for granted.
  </p>
  <p>So that was the extended disclaimer, about why I am presenting an autobiographical work despite my preference. And
    the actual autobiography that I would like to share is the little genealogy of the design history of the “hyped”
    methodologies that I have witnessed.<br>
    This personal history is what motivated me to choose the current topic of my thesis. When it comes to this subject,
    I am angry at the generation of designers before me who didn’t do this work. I’m therefore doing it for the people
    who will enter this field after me.
  </p>
  <p>So the story starts from my high school years. Back then I was at a science high school specializing in biology. I
    accidentally attended the introduction to “design thinking” and was surprisingly convinced by it. <br>
    The fundamental principle of science that I was more familiar with back then was “being skeptical,” but these people
    were so convinced by their own arguments, almost spiritually, that what they called “problems” could be solved
    through such intuitive processes. Looking back, that was the peak of the global hype about design thinking, so much
    so that a lot more people than my 15-year-old self were convinced by the optimism that design thinking propagated.
    And that was also the moment that I chose design as my career path.
  </p>
  <p>Since then, as a believer in this cult, I confess that I was deeply involved in the “design thinking” activities,
    going to rural places in Mongolia, looking for “problems” and proposing “design solutions” that nobody needed,
    attending design events where the participants were “expected to propose alternative design ideas for the world’s
    democracy” in one afternoon. Design Thinking was this kind of ideology popularized by iconic design firms such as
    IDEO, intimately connected to Silicon Valley myths of innovation, that problems can be solved through a series of
    workshops facilitated by designers with a lot of sticky notes on the wall, inviting people that don’t necessarily
    have any background knowledge about the given context and let their “outsider view” intuitively result in solutions.
  </p>
  <p>This seems to be a de-escalating myth in 2023, seeing that IDEO is laying off their staff. Nevertheless, the
    methodology is still a very attractive educational product, and I think design schools will continue teaching and
    reproducing this forever to postpone the complete demystification of the cult. <br>
    Design thinking is an appealing methodology in design schools because the contemporary “problems” are much bigger
    than what a design school can contain, but with the innovation of design thinking, they can reduce the complexity of
    the issue until it fits the size of their post-it notes by simply ignoring the information beyond their cognitive
    capacity. By doing so, the practitioner of design thinking can taste the sense of achievement of “social change” –
    which used to require much more time and “collective” effort – even from a one-day workshop program with your
    classmates. This tendency of reduction is present in every other design method favored by design schools, which I’ll
    talk about later.
  </p>
  <p>My personal peak for the design thinking hype was when I had to make my parents accept that I was going to switch
    to design. And of course, my parents, as if they were trying to check-box all the Asian-parent stereotypes, weren’t
    fond of it. I had to impersonate the believers of design thinking who convinced me to convince my parents.<br>
    So, what I did strategically was to win an international design award to make them understand that “design is a
    thing,” and that “it’s not entirely bullshit.” Usually, I find this too embarrassing to share, but I’m talking about
    this because this is an autobiographical work and it is crucially related to my experience of the issues of design.
    My work awarded by the iF design award was “the design of an urban green tower against air pollution in Mumbai.”
    Even though I’ve never been to Mumbai, using the means of design thinking, I could generate an “innovative” idea
    that was awarded by the prestigious German institution.<br>
    It turned out that I was the youngest winner in the award’s history, because not everyone has Asian parents to
    persuade about their career path, and this news went viral in South Korea back then, which made my parents approve
    of me choosing to study design.
    However, this experience of strategically using the hyped method to create a hype for a political reason, I mean,
    the politics within my family, ironically made me realize the meaninglessness of it, which informed the subsequent
    life decision that I made.
  </p>
  <p>So my “Plan A” back then was to do my bachelor’s at one of the design schools in the US, whose pedagogies were very
    much informed by design thinking. Spontaneously, the skepticism that I’d developed from the aforementioned
    experience made me look for a “Plan B,” which happened to be the Netherlands. The design education in the
    Netherlands was associated with the branding of Dutch Design, a design movement that was very prominent in the first
    decade of the century, represented by the iconic initiatives such as Droog Design. It’s complicated to define what
    Dutch Design is, but if I were to put it bluntly, it is a combination of craft and critical/speculative design
    coined by the British design duo Dunne and Raby, whose work I’m going to talk about soon.
  </p>
  <p>This question of Plan A or B was resolved by a factor that was beyond my control. 2016 was not only the final year
    of my high school but also the year of the US presidential election. I never knew back then that Trump would be
    elected, and I made a satirical statement to my friends that I would go to the Netherlands with no doubt if Trump
    happened to be elected. On the day that this actually happened, my friends googled how to say “bye” in Dutch, and
    kindly told me “Doei Doei to the Netherlands.” I had a painful flashback of this when I was confronted with the
    result of the recent Dutch election.
  </p>
  <p>Another aspect that helped me answer the A/B question was the book “Speculative Everything: design, fiction, and
    social dreaming” by the design duo Dunne and Raby, which was a manifesto referenced in every design school that
    teaches “speculative design.” As the title suggests, it highlights the capacity of design to facilitate the
    speculation of its spectator, therefore insisting what designers can do is perhaps to create design that works in
    fictional scenarios, so it can “initiate interesting discussions” without additional use value. While the intention
    of the duo was proposing a counterculture, the method was adopted by the majority of design schools, especially in
    the Global North, and ended up being no longer a counterculture. I was one of those who were convinced by this
    manifesto, and that was my motivation, other than Trump, that made me choose to study design in the Netherlands.
  </p>

  <p class="highlight">I do believe everything that I just said is not a mere coincidence. I suspect that there was some sort of correlation
    between Trump’s election and the zeitgeist – even though I don’t like this word – that popularized design thinking,
    Dutch Design, and speculative design.
  </p>

  <p>I think about what the popularization of speculative design means, and I think it’s almost the exact reason why
    design thinking was so appealing as an educational product. If the popularity of design thinking originates from it
    reducing the complexity of the world by ignoring what they don’t know, speculative design does that more
    effortlessly by making apolitical fictions and fitting design into it. It’s perfect for fulfilling the ego of young
    and ambitious designers who embody the neoliberal ethos, appreciating “the aesthetics of politics” but too spoiled
    to be affiliated with the actual dirty politics, wanting to reproduce the “star-designer” narratives from the
    previous generation.
  </p>

  <p>To sum up, this is a part of my life experience which has motivated me to work on my current topic of thesis, which is about the correlation between the popularization of speculative design and the precarity of the generation of designers who are practicing it. Looking back my personal relationship with speculative design, delving into fictions and speculative scenarios was my coping mechanism against the institutional pressure to be self-commodifying, which resulted in what my partner described as the perspective of a “formess floating blobby head.” I still believe in the slight possibility of speculation and speculative design in this resistance, however, without clarifying the relationship between speculative design and cruel optimism, I won’t feel comfortable making speculative works again. I’m not going to write explicitly about everything I just said in the thesis, because again, I don’t want to make an autobiographical work, but I know and trust most of you, and I thought the kitchen presentation would be a meaningful occasion to unfold this.
