      <h1>LARPing (institutions, technologies...)</h1>
      <h2>The cases of the AI system LARP and the Design School LARP</h2>
      <p>The workshop, inspired by Live Action Role Play (LARP), was initially developed in response to an invitation
        from ALLAPOPP for their event, supported by LAS Art Foundation, as an embodied and facilitated method to explore
        the potentiality of a decolonial AI system. The format was later adapted to foster collective speculation on
        various other technologies and institutions, such as design schools.

      <p>An AI system, often anthropomorphized, is in fact far from a singular entity but rather an institution composed
        of various workers, infrastructures, fundings, etc. Like any institution, AI is also (partly) made up of people.
        Andrea Fraser writes in her 2005 essay, "It's not a question of being against the institution: We are the
        institution.<a href="#footnote1" id="reference1" class="footnote">1</a> It's a question of what kind of
        institution we are... because the institution of art is internalised, embodied, and performed by individuals,
        these are the questions that institutional critique demands we ask, above all, of ourselves."<a
          href="#footnote2" id="reference2" class="footnote">2</a> If so, we—the participants of the program—are
        accountable for the question of what AI we want to become.
      </p>
      <p>In this session, the participants were introduced to the concept of slow computing<a href="#footnote3"
          id="reference3" class="footnote">3</a>, LARP<a href="#footnote4" id="reference4" class="footnote">4</a>,
        diagrammatic thinking and speculative design.</p>

        <p class="caption">LARP sheets designed for the workshop</p>
      <p>Slowing down the perception of algorithmic processes is crucial to considerately facilitate collective
        attention during the workshop. Each participant, representing an element of an AI system, operated at a mediated
        pace with agency. The collectively negotiated notion of an AI system emerged through the participants’
        interactions around the table, exchanging data, capital, labor and many other forces, akin to that of a live
        action role-play game.<a href="#footnote5" id="reference5" class="footnote">5</a> These interactions were
        facilitated using various printed props including character sheets and data sheets.
      </p>

        alt="The diagram produced during the workshop at Mainz University of Applied Sciences">
      <p class="caption">The diagram produced during the workshop at Mainz University of Applied Sciences</p>
      <p>The AI, in this case, is a diagram, an abstract machine, "the map of relations between forces," “the dynamic,
        fluctuating process occurring between static structures.”<a href="#footnote6" id="reference6"
          class="footnote">6</a> Without relying on schematized representation, the diagram was what the participants
        “become” through the play. Starting from the distribution of character sheets, the participants actively
        embodied the roles that represent their desires and necessities, and explored “the areas of the Venn diagram
        where they do overlap.”<a href="#footnote7" id="reference7" class="footnote">7</a> Consequently, the function of
        each part of the AI system emerged from the collective demands. While this approach is inspired by speculative
        design—the design of non-existing artifacts and systems in fictional “worlds”—the aforementioned approach opens
        up the design process to a facilitated collective with distributed agency, rather than giving excessive emphasis
        to a “heroic designer.”
      </p>
      <p>Participants negotiated what kind of AI they could become. After the rounds of LARP, the participants
        schematized their speculation of an AI system, its functions and its algorithmic processes into a drawn diagram
        on a large piece of paper. The complex process that it describes resembles the aforementioned “Anatomy of an AI
        System” yet it will be represented in a far more decentralized and messy way.

      <p>The same method was applied to the idea of design education as a technology to help the participants of design
        school imagine an emancipatory design education without relying on a singular, heroic storyteller. In the
        workshop session, BA Communication Design students at Mainz University of Applied Sciences, Communication Design
        Department collectively embodied, performed, and speculated on the design school they aspire to create. Each
        participant autonomously acted out their role and interacted with others to bring to life the school they
        envisioned. By filling out character sheets, they embodied the diverse constituent elements of this school, from
        student union members and assistant tutors to the dean and janitor. These interdependent characters negotiated
        and cooperated towards the emancipation of a collectively imagined art school. The speculative organogram
        emerged through the participants’ interactions in the room, as they exchanged capital, information, labor, care,
        and many other forces mediated by the exchange sheets.

      <p>Noam Youngrak Son is a communication designer, design theorist, and cultural worker. Their design
        work encompasses small-scale publishing projects, speculative worldbuilding, workshops, lectures, writing, net
        art, and
        occasional performative interventions. As a cultural worker, they have co-organized the Ghent-based
        queer publishing collective <a href="https://bebebooks.be" target="_blank">Bebe Books</a> since 2021. Son has
        expanded their focus from design to
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hBTyPORE_YEFztVhoPBXjRIsWXqfQjr7/view?usp=sharing"
          target="_blank">theory</a> in order to critically engage with the ontology of the design industry, media, and
        broader
        material culture. This turn is informed by their observations of cultural assemblages that echo the
        extractive operations of capitalism on racialized and more-than-human populations. They are
        particularly attentive to the interconnected notions of speculation—both as an open artistic
        approach and as a process of value increase in capitalism. They research the tendency of the former
        in design to be subjugated by the latter and explore alternative methods for speculative design
        practices to realize their transindividual potential through collective organization and workshop
        facilitation. In this process, Son utilizes queer publishing as a technology for mobilizing
        attention beyond the financialized “scarce resource” of the attention economy. In this context,
        publishing extends beyond mere printed matter to encompass the maintenance of communities and the
        cultivation of interspecies relationships. The term "queer" here is not used as a statement of
        identity but as a process—small yet collective strategies of publishing that challenge the modern
        myth of the heroic designer.
