    <h1>1.8 Million Displaced Here</h1>
    <h2>And they have nowhere else to go.</h2>
    <div id="map"></div>
    <p>I offer you this simple tool to overlay <span class="bold">the size of Al-Mawasi, the so-called ‘humanitarian zone’ near Rafah designated by the Israeli army, where more than 1.4 million Palestinians are displaced</span>, onto the map of your current location. I hope this provides a more tangible understanding of the scale of the ongoing genocide, beyond the schematized geographical representations.</p>
    <p>The following information should help you better contextualize the situation around this area. (Source: Al Jazeera)</p>
    <ul><li>Israel has declared <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/6/how-israel-is-squeezing-1-8-million-palestinians-into-an-airport-sized-area">a mere 6.5sq km (2.5sq miles)</a> of desolate, sandy terrain, within the city to be the humanitarian area where evacuees are supposed to seek shelter. That is an area half the size of London’s Heathrow Airport.</li>
        <li>While Israel has claimed there are safe zones for civilians in Gaza, residents have said no place is safe, and experts pointed out that spaces earmarked by Israel for people to evacuate to are too small or incapable of hosting large displaced populations. People are in dense clusters in the limited space not filled with debris or being bombed by Israel. Conditions are dire, with severe shortages.</li>
        <li>Israel is <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/11/what-is-happening-in-gazas-rafah-as-israel-threatens-to-attack">ramping up its attacks on Rafah</a> as it prepares to mount a ground offensive despite warnings of catastrophic consequences for displaced Palestinians and the United States saying it won’t back an assault on the southern Gaza Strip because it would be a “disaster”.</li>
        <li>Israel is already killing more than 100 people a day in air attacks on Rafah. Those who survive the attacks live in unspeakable conditions in tents that fill with water whenever it rains, or under whatever scraps they find to make a shelter.</li>
