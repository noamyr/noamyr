        <div class="item w"><div><p class="body"><span class="bold">“Yummy Body Truck” is a fictional food truck that sells ‘edible human body parts’. The stall collects samples of organisms found nearby, grinds their flesh into mouldable paste, and reshapes it into forms of human bodies.</span> Different types of flesh can be characterised by factors such as pigmentation, endocrinological condition and toxin accumulation. As the paste is shaped into body parts, those aspects gain more political significance: The pigmentation of brown meat turns into ‘race’, and oestrogen residue determines ‘gender’. The truck serves the body parts in a lunchbox, and an instruction video guides visitors on how to see, smell and taste them. The flavours of pigments, hormones and toxins make them more aware of the nuances of the bodies that they eat.</p></div></div>

        <div class="item n"><div><p class="body">Thank you for choosing our edible human bodies. Please open the package and follow the steps that I'm going to introduce. We collect samples of every organism that we could encounter around our stall, grind their flesh altogether into a moldable paste and reshape it into forms of human bodies. So far, we have collected bodies of three hundred thousand species globally, and humans are not exceptional here. 0.0003% of the DNA in our paste is from humans. Every species in the paste has a distinctive gastronomical-ecological-political profile, and you have to use all your sense to distinguish those nuances.

        <div class="item n"><div><p class="body">First of all, look at the color of the human bodies on your plate. Various types of pigments determine the colors of our food. The flesh remains white if it doesn't contain any pigment. Myoglobin in the red meat becomes brown when it's cooked. Carotenoids make salmons, shrimps, flamingos pink. There are numerous pigments that I can't mention in this instruction, but I shouldn't forget melanin, which determines the color of human skin. This is the pigment that makes pigmentation a crucial political factor of our food because the melanin concentration of human skin is regarded as the primary factor of the human construct of race. All of the bodies blended into our food are racialized because of their pigments. What is the race of the human body on your plate?
        </p></div></div>
        <div class="item n"><div><p class="body">The next step is to smell your food. How does it feel? Are you aroused? If so, that's the influence of hormones. Our blended flesh contains a wide variety of hormones. Hormones are in bodies naturally, but sometimes with a clear human intention or even as an unintended consequence of human activities. Hormones such as estrogens, DES, Progesterone, MLGA reside in meats from veterinary drugs. Waterborne pollutants such as BPA can also remain in bodies and function as xenohormones. Regardless of their sources, but by their effects, hormones create another political dimension for our edible human bodies. Humans arbitrarily name estrogens and progesterones "female hormones" and androgens such as testosterone "male hormones" even though these hormones are much more permeable and ubiquitous than that binary understanding. This makes every single bite of our food gendered. But the fact that our foods are mixtures of a lot of different types of flesh makes their gender ambiguous, and hopefully, you might be able to smell this.
        </p></div></div>
        <div class="item n"><div><p class="body">And finally, This is the moment to have a bite. You should bear in mind that every species blended into our edible human bodies contains a considerable amount of environmental toxins, which refers to synthetic contaminants such as industrial pollutants and other artificially made toxic substances. As we all live in contaminated environments, every flesh is toxic. A relevant question here is not "If this is toxic" but rather "how toxic this is". This is also a useful indication for assuming a relative position of an organism in a food web. The more reliant an organism is on the other species for its feeding, the higher accumulation of environmental toxins it will have. In this regards, if the human bodies on your plate are so toxic that it makes you suffer, it's very unlikely to be vegan, but rather closer to the flesh of predators. This is an accurate representation of an actual human body because humans are often at the top of the food web, and therefore, have highly toxic flesh. Please use your tastebuds to feel these subtleties. Humans have evolved with bitter taste receptors sensitive to certain types of toxins, so if you find your food bitter, there's a chance for it to be toxic.

        <div class="item w"><div><p class="body">Once you're done with your edible human bodies, you can make a payment. The price of what you ate will depend on the scarcity of the species included in your food. If those species are abundant, your food will be cheap, while it can be more expensive if it includes endangered species. Our staffs sincerely wish that the flavors of pigments, hormones, and toxins from our edible human bodies made you more aware of the nuances of the bodies that you eat. Thank you and see you next time.
