            <h1>The Union* for Unvalorized (design) Labors</h1>
            <h2>Why are all my designer friends overworked and underpaid?</h2>
            <p>“The Union* for Unvalorized (design) Labors” is a research project and workshop series which started from
                the question “Why are all my designer friends overworked and underpaid?” In this project, I proposed the
                term ‘unvalorized design’ to refer to the types of design that create values that are not economically
                compensated fairly. As a speculative experiment, I insisted on creating an organization that represents
                the precarity of unvalorized designers. The process of elaborating on this union consists of a series of
                interviews and workshops. In the interviews, the stakeholders of the cultural sector around unvalorized
                design were invited, including artists (<a href="https://theofficeofalinalupu.com" target="_blank"

                    class="link">Morgane Billuart</a>), and Designers (<a href="http://designforthetimebeing.com"

                    class="link">Cherry-Ann Davis</a>) whose practices concern the precarity of creative labor, as well
                as the other stakeholders of the cultural sector around design such as a journalist and activist (<a
                    href="https://state-of-the-arts.net" target="_blank" class="link">Wouter Hillaert</a>), a lawyer (<a
                    href="https://www.twiiid.be" target="_blank" class="link">Tobias van Royen</a>), and an educator (<a
                    href="https://www.imadgebrayel.com" target="_blank" class="link">Imad Gebrayel</a>). They were asked
                how can the value of unvalorized design be recognised more significantly and how the livelihood of its
                practitioners can become more sustainable.</p>
            <p>The interviews were followed by an ongoing workshop series that gathered the participants who consider
                themselves as ‘unvalorized designers’. The findings from the interviews were provided as sources of
                inspiration for the workshop participants. They discussed what their shared precarity is, what are their
                corresponding demands, and to whom and how those demands can be addressed. The opinions of the
                contributors didn’t always align and sometimes required a process of negotiation. Gathering people under
                the slogan of a fictional organization was a bottom-up way of speculating that will never reach a
                conclusive state but remain malleable to make more bodies and stories involved.</p>

            <p>Since the issue of precarity is closely tied to the specificities of local contexts, the workshop is
                adapted to the different countries and cities where it is held. One edition of the workshop was situated
                in Halle, Germany, as a part of the Dis/Assembly of Performative Things event. The subsequent edition
                took place in Eindhoven, hosted by Onomatopee, as a part of the HistoricALL! program and the discussion
                was published in <a

            <p>Noam Youngrak Son is a communication designer, design theorist, and cultural worker. Their design
                work encompasses small-scale publishing projects, speculative worldbuilding, workshops, lectures,
                writing, net art, and
                occasional performative interventions. As a cultural worker, they have co-organized the Ghent-based
                queer publishing collective <a href="https://bebebooks.be" target="_blank">Bebe Books</a> since 2021.
                Son has expanded their focus from design to
                <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hBTyPORE_YEFztVhoPBXjRIsWXqfQjr7/view?usp=sharing"
                    target="_blank">theory</a> in order to critically engage with the ontology of the design industry,
                media, and broader
                material culture. This turn is informed by their observations of cultural assemblages that echo the
                extractive operations of capitalism on racialized and more-than-human populations. They are
                particularly attentive to the interconnected notions of speculation—both as an open artistic
                approach and as a process of value increase in capitalism. They research the tendency of the former
                in design to be subjugated by the latter and explore alternative methods for speculative design
                practices to realize their transindividual potential through collective organization and workshop
                facilitation. In this process, Son utilizes queer publishing as a technology for mobilizing
                attention beyond the financialized “scarce resource” of the attention economy. In this context,
                publishing extends beyond mere printed matter to encompass the maintenance of communities and the
                cultivation of interspecies relationships. The term "queer" here is not used as a statement of
                identity but as a process—small yet collective strategies of publishing that challenge the modern
                myth of the heroic designer.
