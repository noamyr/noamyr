        <div class="item n"><div><p class="body">While broadening the impact of designers to social critiques, speculative and critical design have resulted in reflective research methods that have diverged from traditional design market demands. While promoted by many design education and hinting at some valuable critical thought experiments, it remained a niche in the market, leading many (young) practitioners to get confronted to the struggles of earning a living in a field that is already precarious for most independent workers. Besides, the more traditional ways of mobilizing political power –such as unionizing– are hard to bring to concretion for cultural freelancers as they are not bound by common employment structures.
        </p></div></div>

        <div class="item n"><div><p class="body">The workshop will be built around a fictional organization addressing the precarity of un-valorized design labor. Using speculative design methodologies, we will attempt to tackle some inherent and inherited issues peculiar to the field’s conditions. <br><br>
            The aim is to look at how these shared struggles can meaningfully extend into solidarity by practicing maintenance and care with other precarious workers (not only confined to the design field).
        </p></div></div>

        <div class="item n"><div><p class="body">The workshop was conceptualized in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nhTDx-Dwg3jjjVlcq6VSfIWCNJd_q2XA/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112815296256990720170&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank" class="link">an article with the same title</a> published in Ponton Magazine by Z33. <br><br>
            Since the issue of precarity is closely tied to the specificities of local contexts, the workshop is adapted to the different countries and cities where it is held. One edition of the workshop was situated in Halle, Germany, as a part of the Dis/Assembly of Performative Things event. The subsequent edition took place in Eindhoven, hosted by Onomatopee, as a part of the HistoricALL! program and the discussion was published in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CZOXR0mWN4xmPxzgHMLIlXIjPMGaNbha/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="link">an open letter format</a> that can circulate within the design scene.
