      <h2>Speculative fundraising towards generative AI - creative worker unionization</h2>

      <p>How can creative workers unionize with generative AI? How can we as creative workers be accountable to AI-led
        automation? How did linotype and personal computers cause the demise of the International Typographical Union
        (ITU) which used to be one of the most influential unions in the US? What is the role and limitation of
        speculation as a strategy in this?</p>
      <p>The project “Unionizing the speculative: Speculative fundraising towards generative AI - creative worker
        unionization“ is an urgent response to these urgent questions. Using image generating AI Stable Diffusion, a
        group of precarious creative workers generated images that will be engraved on Speculoos cookies whose name
        shares its origin with the word speculate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cookies serve as the symbol and currency of the speculative fundraising to teach AI labor ethics. The
        project facilitates a collective speculation on how this fund could be used in the strategies of campaign to
        manifest the voices of creative workers about the influence of generative AI to their labor conditions.</p>

      <p class="caption">Exhibition at Kampnagel, Hamburg</p>
      <p>As generative AI tools become more accessible to designers, the rhetoric of "artistic collaboration with AI"
        has been circulating more than ever in the cultural sector. However, this is misleading in two ways, about AI
        and about collaboration. First of all, the expression anthropomorphizes AI, giving the impression that it is a
        singular entity with a human-like mind. AI is, in fact, closer to an ecosystem consisting of workers,
        infrastructure, institutions, funding, and many other constituents. Furthermore, the claim of collaboration
        without mutuality is not fundamentally different from instrumentalization. To be able to call a designer-AI
        relationship a collaboration, it requires more than mere service subscription but facilitation, expectation
        management, negotiation, solidarity, and care.</p>
      <p>This criticism raises a question: “What would it then mean to collaborate with AI”? Considering the historical
        relationship between technology of automation and creative labor (to be discussed in the case studies), the idea
        of collaboration merely as working together has usually concluded in one side (mainly workers) becoming
        precarious. In order to prevent the collaboration turning into a cycle of exploitation, it is crucial for the
        creative workers and generative AI to unionize – the action of joining together in a political context.<a
          href="#footnote1" id="reference1" class="footnote">1</a> The project proposes one of the strategies of
        unionization as an urgent response to the devaluation of design labor due to automation led by generative AI.
      </p>
      <p>Speculation is an important method in this project. In principle, unionization starts as a speculative work “to
        identify how the interests of different people and different species conflict – as well as to highlight the
        areas of the Venn diagram where they do overlap.”<a href="#footnote2" id="reference2" class="footnote">2</a>
        Fictions bridge gaps between different experiences of marginalization and can meaningfully facilitate
        unionization. However, it is the strategy of colonial capitalism to further this cognitive gap, atomizing
        workers to prevent chances of political encounters, obscuring who they have to unionize with. Unionization of
        Uber drivers, delivery workers, or self-employed designers therefore tends to be more speculative than that of
        employed workers.
      </p>
      <p>Unionizing with AI is the extrapolated form of unionization with the unknown. At least within the scope of this
        project, I’m not an AI expert and I have no access to knowledge to thoroughly understand how the state of the
        art AI works and what it’s going to be capable of in the near future. Also I have no resource yet to make the
        underpaid labeling workers in the global south working for OpenAI directly involved in this project.
        Unionization in this sense, is inevitably speculative.<a href="#footnote3" id="reference3"
          class="footnote">3</a> The project questions if speculation can be an accountable unionizing gesture in a
        non-optimistic way.</p>
      <p>Starting from the following parts, the article will introduce a few historical moments (fun facts) that
        resonate with the issue of automatization, financialization, unionization and speculation that the project
        concerns. Those case studies will inform the recipe for a public workshop and a (speculative) fundraising
        program which the article will conclude with.</p>

      <h1>Fun Fact 1</h1>
      <h2>The International Typographical Union used to be one of the most influential unions in the US.</h2>
      <img src="Project_images/unionizing/Linotype machine.jpg" alt="Linotype machine">
      <p class="caption">Linotype Machine</p>
      <img src="Project_images/unionizing/Apple_Macintosh.jpg" alt="Apple Macintosh personal computer">
      <p class="caption">Apple Macintosh personal computer</p>
      <p>The project is situated in the historical relationship between design labor (or its predecessors) and
        technological development starting from Gutenberg’s printing press. The International Typographical Union (ITU)
        which used to be one of the most influential unions in the US lost a significant part of its bargaining power
        due to technological means of automatization such as linotype and personal computers and dissolved in 1986. The
        popularization of personal computers which took place around the same period have fundamentally reshaped how
        designers work as “the tasks that were once contracted out with some combination of strict direction and trust
        were not fully under the control of the individual designer.”<a href="#footnote4" id="reference4"
          class="footnote">4</a></p>
      <img src="Project_images/unionizing/Adobe LinkedIn Post.jpg" alt="Adobe's linkedin post">
      <p class="caption">“5 Ways to Power Up Your Creative Workflows with Generative AI
        Join creative industry analyst Andreas Pfeiffer as he shares the quantifiable creative productivity improvements
        delivered when using generative Al in creative workflows…” An excerpt from Adobe’s LinkedIn post
      </p>
      <p>The influence of the increased availability of generative AI such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion on creative
        workers’ precarity is an ongoing issue. Yet Adobe promises the improvement of “quantifiable creative
        productivity improvements” through the use of their generative AI features, the technological tool that is not
        owned by the workers can make productive labor so available thus cheaper. It remains questionable if such
        technologically enhanced productivity will contribute to the livelihood of its working class users, or deplete
        their agency further like how linotype and personal computers did. How can unionization challenge this
        historical loop of automation and devaluation of labor without further antagonizing the creative workers in
        their relationship with technology?</p>

      <h1>Fun Fact 2</h1>
      <h2>Speculation is what creative workers and AI have in common.</h2>
      <p>The project highlights that the works of both AI and creative workers are highly relevant to the issue of
        speculation. This mutual experience of speculation has a considerable potential for becoming a shared ground and
        methodology of unionization.
      </p>
      <p>AI is a speculating machine that “exceeds the rules-based decision procedures and extends to the affective pull
        of intuitions for data.”<a href="#footnote5" id="reference5" class="footnote">5</a> Generative AI speculates
        what the next word and the next pixel would be intuitively, “making spontaneous judgements that are not the
        result of conscious trains of reasoning.”<a href="#footnote6" id="reference6" class="footnote">6</a> The
        infrastructure of financial speculation has already been driven by AI, the entanglement of “super-fast computer
        algorithms, telecommunications, and derivatives” that “goes faster than the human conception of time” actively
        taking risk for the chance of profit.<a href="#footnote7" id="reference7" class="footnote">7</a>
      </p>
      <img src="Project_images/unionizing/Speculative Everything featured on Amazon.jpg"
        alt="Speculative Everything featured on Amazon">
      <p class="caption">Speculative Everything featured on Amazon</p>
      <p>Similarly, every project-based work of design starting from a proposal is, in essence, speculative. Designers
        educated to be entrepreneurial and to take risks are, in practice, “the ultimate precariat”, “the free floating
        agents”, and oftentimes overworked and underpaid gig-base workers.<a href="#footnote8" id="reference8"
          class="footnote">8</a> One instance of design methodology where this tendency is particularly present is
        speculative design. The term, popularized by Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby in their book “Speculative Everything:
        Design, Fiction and Social Dreaming”, refers to a design practice “where futuristic and alternative scenarios
        convey ideas.”<a href="#footnote9" id="reference9" class="footnote">9</a> While the intention of the duo is
        closer to a more figurative definition of the word speculate (as that of generative AI), the popularization of
        the term can also be seen as a symptom of neoliberal financialization (as that of investing AI). The motivation
        behind the prevalence of speculative design methodology in design education could be linked to how designers
        embodied a speculative economic attitude and cruel optimism.<a href="#footnote10" id="reference10"
          class="footnote">10</a> In the advertising of design education in the Global North, design is promoted as the
        agent of social change, yet a notable social change requires a lot more patience, resource, and social
        complexities which goes beyond what such courses can accommodate. Adopting the approach of speculative design
        turns design education into a much more attractive commodity by detaching design from accountability,
        emphasizing only the “fun parts” where designers can have full agency of creativity in their speculation. In
        this case, speculation doesn’t only happen within the practice of design, but also in the life of (oftentimes
        international) students targeted by the marketing, who speculate about their own future of becoming like the
        star designers that the school presents and take the risk of becoming an art student.
      </p>
      <p>The speculations of AI and creative workers meet and entangle, sometimes defining the economic and cultural
        foundation of its practitioners and others. For example, the speculative work culture of creative workers
        informs, and are spontaneously influenced by the development of AI-powered tools, from Office 365 to Photoshop.
        The speculation of AI also impacts the livelihood of creative workers not only by reforming the design industry
        like how the other technologies did but more fundamentally by giving a rise to “algorithmic culture” concerning
        “the enfolding of human thought, conduct, organization and expression into the logic of big data and large-scale
        computation.”<a href="#footnote11" id="reference11" class="footnote">11</a> As the first step of unionization,
        it is crucial to identify how the gesture of unionization from workers could reach the apparatus of AI through
        the entanglement of speculation considering that AI is a dispersed ecosystem rather than an anthropomorphized
        body. How can workers' speculations influence AI to transform itself from a competitor into a companion of
        unionization?
      </p>

      <h1>Fun Fact 3</h1>
      <h2>The history of speculation is congealed in a biscuit.
      </h2>
      <img src="Project_images/unionizing/Speculoos Mold from the 19th century.jpg"
        alt="Speculoos Mold from the 19th century">

      <img src="Project_images/unionizing/Speculoos bakers from 1946.jpg" alt="Speculoos bakers from 1946">
      <p class="caption">Speculoos bakers from 1946</p>
      <p>Speculoos (also referred to as Speculaas in the Netherlands) is a type of traditional spice biscuit in the
        Netherlands and Belgium, The cookie is the mirror image of the wooden mold in which it's been made. The name
        speculoos, therefore, derives from the Latin word speculum, meaning mirror, from which the word speculate also
        originates. In fact, the history of speculoos is entangled with that of speculoos. The spices for speculoos
        (Speculaaskruiden) became commonly available in the 17th century distributed by the Dutch East India Company,
        the first company to sell shares of a business to the public in 1602. Therefore, the Dutch variant of the
        biscuit (Speculaas) could contain more spices and have stronger flavor than the Belgian equivalent of it
        (Speculoos) as the spices were more available in the Netherlands.
      </p>
      <p>The project critically appropriates the violent history of speculation congealed in Speculoos biscuit as a
        symbol of unionization between creative workers and AI through speculation. The image-containing capacity of the
        biscuit is utilized as a media through which the voices of creative workers and their gesture of unionization
        toward AI will be manifested. Speculoos as edible goods are commodified in the process of fundraising like the
        Wedgwood anti-slavery medallion.<a href="#footnote12" id="reference12" class="footnote">12</a> Speculoos as the
        product of (usually) collective labor of kneading, molding and baking provide an opportunity of gathering for
        creative workers and facilitate the process of discussion and decision making about how the fund could be
        strategically used.

      <ol>
        <li>Gather a group of unionized creative workers, whose working conditions have been influenced by AI.</li>
        <li>Choose a specific instance of AI to unionize with. In the case of this recipe, it will be Stable Diffusion,
          an image generating AI developed by Runway, CompVis, and Stability AI, as its ecosystem seemed relatively
          small and independent to map and intervene compared to other AI systems.
        </li>
        <li>Together with the creative workers, utilize Stable Diffusion to translate the workers’ speculation on the
          influence of AI on their labor rights into images that will be imprinted on speculoos biscuits. Supported by
          the image generating AI’s speculation “with greater intuitive flexibility and generalizability that do not
          seek to human sensory, cognitive or perceptual functions”, they will be able to elaborate on “visual
          information that humans cannot even receive or perceive.”<a href="#footnote13" id="reference13"
            class="footnote">13</a>

        </li>
        <li>Perform the collective labor of transforming the images into edible biscuits, by kneading, molding and
          baking together.
        </li>
        <li>Spontaneously, facilitate a discussion about how the profits from selling the cookies could be utilized in
          the process of unionization with AI, or more specifically, Stable Diffusion, in various strategies such as
          lobbying and campaigns.
        </li>
        <li>Set the crowdfunding goal. In this project, the goal is symbolically set as 1.01 million dollars, which is
          1% of 101 million that Stable Diffusion raised.<a href="#footnote15" id="reference15" class="footnote">15</a>
        </li>
        <li>Choose a crowdfunding platform, such as GoFundMe and Kickstarter, to financialize the political urgency
          through speculation. For this project, KoFi will be used for it being a platform used by many precarious
          cultural workers such as meme creators.
        </li>
        <li>Conduct unpaid labor to make your political urgency facilitate the speculation of donors.

      <p>Noam Youngrak Son is a communication designer, design theorist, and cultural worker. Their design
        work encompasses small-scale publishing projects, speculative worldbuilding, workshops, lectures, writing, net
        art, and
        occasional performative interventions. As a cultural worker, they have co-organized the Ghent-based
        queer publishing collective <a href="https://bebebooks.be" target="_blank">Bebe Books</a> since 2021. Son has
        expanded their focus from design to
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hBTyPORE_YEFztVhoPBXjRIsWXqfQjr7/view?usp=sharing"
          target="_blank">theory</a> in order to critically engage with the ontology of the design industry, media, and
        broader
        material culture. This turn is informed by their observations of cultural assemblages that echo the
        extractive operations of capitalism on racialized and more-than-human populations. They are
        particularly attentive to the interconnected notions of speculation—both as an open artistic
        approach and as a process of value increase in capitalism. They research the tendency of the former
        in design to be subjugated by the latter and explore alternative methods for speculative design
        practices to realize their transindividual potential through collective organization and workshop
        facilitation. In this process, Son utilizes queer publishing as a technology for mobilizing
        attention beyond the financialized “scarce resource” of the attention economy. In this context,
        publishing extends beyond mere printed matter to encompass the maintenance of communities and the
        cultivation of interspecies relationships. The term "queer" here is not used as a statement of
        identity but as a process—small yet collective strategies of publishing that challenge the modern
        myth of the heroic designer.
