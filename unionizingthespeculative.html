            <h1>Unionizing the speculative</h1>
            <h2>Speculative fundraising towards generative AI - creative worker unionization</h2>

            <p>As generative AI tools become more accessible to designers, the rhetoric of "artistic collaboration with AI" has been circulating more than ever in the cultural sector. However, this is misleading in two ways, about AI and about collaboration. First of all, the expression anthropomorphizes AI, giving the impression that it is a singular entity with a human-like mind. AI is, in fact, closer to an ecosystem consisting of workers, infrastructure, institutions, funding, and many other constituents. Furthermore, the claim of collaboration without mutuality is not fundamentally different from instrumentalization. To be able to call a designer-AI relationship a collaboration, it requires more than mere service subscription but facilitation, expectation management, negotiation, solidarity, and care.</p>
            <p>This criticism raises a question: “What would it then mean to collaborate with AI”? Considering the historical relationship between technology of automation and creative labor (to be discussed in the case studies), the idea of collaboration merely as working together has usually concluded in one side (mainly workers) becoming precarious. In order to prevent the collaboration turning into a cycle of exploitation, it is crucial for the creative workers and generative AI to unionize – the action of joining together in a political context.<a href="#footnote1" id="reference1" class="footnote">1</a> The project proposes one of the strategies of unionization as an urgent response to the devaluation of design labor due to automation led by generative AI.</p>
            <p>Speculation is an important method in this project. In principle, unionization starts as a speculative work “to identify how the interests of different people and different species conflict – as well as to highlight the areas of the Venn diagram where they do overlap.” Fictions bridge gaps between different experiences of marginalization and can meaningfully facilitate unionization. However, it is the strategy of colonial capitalism to further this cognitive gap, atomizing workers to prevent chances of political encounters, obscuring who they have to unionize with. Unionization of Uber drivers, delivery workers, or self-employed designers therefore tends to be more speculative than that of employed workers.
            </p>
            <p>Unionizing with AI is the extrapolated form of unionization with the unknown. At least within the scope of this project, I’m not an AI expert and I have no access to knowledge to thoroughly understand how the state of the art AI works and what it’s going to be capable of in the near future. Also I have no resource yet to make the underpaid labeling workers in the global south working for OpenAI directly involved in this project. Unionization in this sense, is inevitably speculative. The project questions if speculation can be an accountable unionizing gesture in a non-optimistic way.</p>
            <p>Starting from the following parts, the article will introduce a few historical moments (fun facts) that resonate with the issue of automatization, financialization, unionization and speculation that the project concerns. Those case studies will inform the recipe for a public workshop and a (speculative) fundraising program which the article will conclude with.</p>

            <h1>Fun Fact 1</h1>
            <h2>The International Typographical Union used to be one of the most influential unions in the US.</h2>

            <img src="Project_images/unionizing/Apple_Macintosh.jpg" alt="Apple Macintosh personal computer">
            <p class="caption">Apple Macintosh personal computer</p>
            <p>The project is situated in the historical relationship between design labor (or its predecessors) and technological development starting from Gutenberg’s printing press. The International Typographical Union (ITU) which used to be one of the most influential unions in the US lost a significant part of its bargaining power due to technological means of automatization such as linotype and personal computers and dissolved in 1986. The popularization of personal computers which took place around the same period have fundamentally reshaped how designers work as “the tasks that were once contracted out with some combination of strict direction and trust were not fully under the control of the individual designer.”</p>

            <p>Noam Youngrak Son is a communication designer, design theorist, and cultural worker. Their design
                work encompasses small-scale publishing projects, speculative worldbuilding, workshops, lectures, writing, net art, and
                occasional performative interventions. As a cultural worker, they have co-organized the Ghent-based
                queer publishing collective <a href="https://bebebooks.be" target="_blank">Bebe Books</a> since 2021. Son has expanded their focus from design to
                <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hBTyPORE_YEFztVhoPBXjRIsWXqfQjr7/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">theory</a> in order to critically engage with the ontology of the design industry, media, and broader
                material culture. This turn is informed by their observations of cultural assemblages that echo the
                extractive operations of capitalism on racialized and more-than-human populations. They are
                particularly attentive to the interconnected notions of speculation—both as an open artistic
                approach and as a process of value increase in capitalism. They research the tendency of the former
                in design to be subjugated by the latter and explore alternative methods for speculative design
                practices to realize their transindividual potential through collective organization and workshop
                facilitation. In this process, Son utilizes queer publishing as a technology for mobilizing
                attention beyond the financialized “scarce resource” of the attention economy. In this context,
                publishing extends beyond mere printed matter to encompass the maintenance of communities and the
                cultivation of interspecies relationships. The term "queer" here is not used as a statement of
                identity but as a process—small yet collective strategies of publishing that challenge the modern
                myth of the heroic designer.</p>
