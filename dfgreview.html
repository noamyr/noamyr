Using the OCR function of an iPhone, I could transcribe those images into an extensive amount of text data consisting of 45957 words, 2380 sentences. Then I programmed a simple algorithm that analyzes how different concepts are associated with each other by counting how many times they were written in the same sentences. This tool provided some meaningful hints for the questions that I had about the way that we perceive, comprehend and communicate about design particularly in the context of Design Fest Gent.</p></div></div>

        <div class="item n"><div><p class="body"><span class="subtitle">What is design?</span> <br><br> Since design is established as a discipline, there have been numerous definitions of design. Now the notion of design is plural, and that of mine probably won’t be identical to that of yours. The statistical tool demonstrated what the average perception of the word ‘design’ was during Design Fest Gent. <br><br>

            From the list of the words, it appeared that design is about ‘objects’ ‘made’ of ‘materials’ into commodified forms that we call ‘products’ that are sold at ‘shops’. At the same time, the practices of design also consist of ‘projects’ driven by ‘studios’ or ‘students’ incorporating ‘research’ and ‘development’ in search of ‘new’ or ‘more’ ‘circular’ ‘approaches’. And a ‘museum’ is where ‘you’ learn about what ‘we’ did as ‘designers’. Above all these, what was emphasized the most about design was its situatedness at ‘Design Fest Gent’.

        <div class="item n"><div><p class="body"><span class="subtitle">How gendered is design?</span> <br><br> Design has never been gender-neutral starting from the example of Bauhaus where female students were strongly encouraged to choose ‘softer’ and ‘more domestic’ mediums such as textile. And in the fields that are considered ‘more concrete’ such as product design and architecture, the most represented designers in higher positions are predominantly male. I used the algorithmic tool to find out which concepts are frequently associated with the gendered pronouns ‘he’ and ‘she’.<br><br>

            Compared to the example of Bauhaus, the gender-based differentiation at Design Fest Gent appears more nuanced yet still prevalent. The projects of male designers reported themselves as ‘extensive’ ‘works’ about the ‘land’, ‘architecture’ and ‘objects’ that ‘research’ and ‘investigate’ the ‘natural’ and ‘cultural’ ‘materials’. Meanwhile, the works of female designers ‘looked’ for the ‘other’ ‘possible’ ‘processes’ by ‘using’ ‘materials’ such as ‘wool’ and ‘seaweed’ for ‘new’ ‘shapes’ and ‘colors’. These results allude to an urgency for Design Fest Gent to give more exposure to female designers in the fields where male designers are more typically represented, and vice versa to male designers. 
            <br><br>
            What is also important to note is that gender is not a binary concept, and there is a considerable number of people including myself who don’t neatly fit into the category of ‘he’ or ‘she’. This matters in the local context of the festival because Ghent is one of the most LGBT-friendly cities in Flanders with a dynamic queer community. Gender-non-conformity can be represented in language by the use of gender-neutral pronouns, singular ‘they’ in the case of English. The technical challenge that I had while applying the algorithm to the singular ‘they’ pronoun was to distinguish it from the plural ‘they’ pronoun. This job would require a much more complicated algorithm that can read the nuance of sentences, because the singular and plural ‘they’ pronouns are used in almost the same grammatical way. However, it was not necessary at all in this case because I could not find any use of a singular they pronoun in the 45957 words that I collected. This means a severe lack of queer representation at the whole Design Fest Gent, and it is not a coincidence that there were only two gender-neutral bathrooms in eleven venues that I visited.

        <div class="item n"><div><p class="body"><span class="subtitle">What do we mean by better?</span> <br><br> What was notable in the festival was the fact that the question “How does it contribute to a better world?” appeared repeatedly in almost every project description. It was interesting to observe the varying notions of the word ‘better’ interpreted by different designers. I used the same algorithmic tool to find out the average idea of ‘better’ used at Design Fest Gent.

            What I could instantly notice was more frequent use of first person pronouns such as ‘I’ and ‘my’, which relates to the fact that ‘better’ is the most subjective concept that I can think of. Starting from those personal motivations, the focus of the designers extended toward the ‘world’, ‘we’, ‘together’. I would like to conclude this observation with an optimistic remark that the way designers ‘contribute’ to the world is indeed through this process of creative translation from ‘I’ to ‘we’ like what this result reveals. It is crucial to keep widening the notion of ‘we’ to have more diverse bodies involved in the practice of design.

        <div class="item w"><div><p class="body"><span class="subtitle">Acknowledgments</span> <br><br> I acknowledge this research methodology has its constraints. The OCR tool that I used can only recognize latin alphabets, which excludes non-Latin script languages including my mother tongue. I only included English descriptions that I could collect from the venues that were open on the 23rd of April. Data is the new currency in the time of surveillance capitalism, thus the limitations of the data collection originate from the lack of resources.

            When the same algorithm is used to predict the most probable phrase that will come after a specific phrase, it turns into a text generator that creates an endless stream of text by referencing the input. You can find this in the background of this page.
