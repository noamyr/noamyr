Pacific McDonalds messages such as girlfriend and boyfriend. impotent and lost My little Covid-19 kit says I am too stoned shaping an apocalypse disco in twitch and glide but somehow we all left anyway trusting the current.

sexy noises I am an eel sexy eels, thicker and darker. Hey Fooo I’m a child. failure in Identification. 

My father eel was anonymous or all. My mother eel was goddess of all. 

I made my way to the soup. There's bits and pieces everywhere.I’m delicious and sexy.

how wonderful and sassy the noises like SSSSS or like EEEE or QWASERF

Scrimping eels in a saving mood, a bit euphoric about the upcoming event. “What do you like?” And I paused. And I haven’t stopped pausing since. I can’t find my way to Saragasso, I can’t find my little boxers and I’m terrified.

I am not yours, I realized that my body was no longer.making sexy currents, failing wet dream,I hope I know where to go to trace their tiny little cells

Sexy eels all the sexy eels I hear them, I hear them shaking up the waters the seas the lakes the rivers and seas and lakes. 
Like the lighting effortlessly and with so much grace. 
I swim. I’m delicious and sexy.
 
I want to be a glassy eel, yellow eel, silver eel and to be a larva again I am not your food I don't belong to your aquarium or your plate or your mouth or your teeth or your gullet or your stomach or your intestines or your bowels I am not your food I don't belong to your aquarium or your plate or your mouth or your teeth or your gullet or your stomach or your intestines or your bowels: I am not yours to decide. Becoming a non transparent individual is my life. Not only to be seen by others but in the end act as a silver mirror to look at myself and look back at my life.

The man is not shiny he reflects nothing. I don’t understand. I thought you came from outer space. Men are from Mars, right? You’re dull and hot and sticky and get away from me.
Still, I’m reluctant to call myself a dyke

how wonderful and sassy the noises like SSSSS or like EEEE or QWASERF
I love listening to them with my eel body
my eel particles
For I am the eel
only eels can understand the sexy noises
One time I was indistinguishable and that was wonderful

I’m delicious and sexy. Humans use me like a dildo

I function partly or entirely. I'm your partial or whole pleasure.

Hey Fooo, do you wanna go with me and check out what’s up there? 
I wanna find out what kind of machine they use not so far up there.
Hey Doo, do u wanna go with me  I’m kind of in a rush
I saw the machine they use up there and it made me blush
Now we get away from here,
free of pain and guilt
for we do not belong to fear
free of human quilts

the bed remembers whose egg is fertilised. 
the bed remembers the way. 
off they go in pairs of two.
three or four is taboo.

Let me in! I’m still looking for my cool mask and my little spandex shorts.The boxing ring is ruthless and I don't understand, I thought this was a match!

The babies have to know exactly who have born them!
For they are the eel.

but I’m shitting myself. One day I’ll do it

I collected currents, temperatures. And still I don’t know how to say, “I’m sorry, I’ve never been here before”. And still, I don’t know how to stop apologizing.

I am as long as I will live. 

I pass to you the genes, the genes that will tell you how to survive. And yet I'm still not sure. How come I'm on the plate if my genes are so wonderfully intricate. Shouldn't I be shaking the waters in the most wonderful ways?

I made my way to the soup I came from. It’s like walking in and out of the same room and thinking I will die in there. I sometimes think about heaven or hell. Heaven is slime. Hell is salt. When I die I want to die in slime not salt. And I wanna die having an orgasm. It’s hard to cum, it’s hard to stay.
Reflecting the sun beautifully Going through currents With or against them

I would really rather not be expensive. I can't buy jewellery and I don't care for dolls to play with. There's more to do, there's more to spit, there's more to make!

Ships and containers
Currents and commodities
Not me
I am the newborn
I travel where I want to
Or will I be shipped and contained
Along the currents like commodities
Me
For I am the real eel

Hah! You couldn’t count my eggs if you wanted to.

My body still remains translucent, reflecting the sun
I never got there. I’ll never die.
I'll never have sex, how comforting.
Dying eventually becomes obsolete.
Still, I’m reluctant to pass to you the genes


PEOPLE UP THERE are obsessed with blood. They don’t understand that you don’t need it to go back to Saragasso

rararararara~ Oopsy rock scissor paper! life is too long. how many AH Perhaps seven of them?Isn’t that crazy?Sex appeal Happy eel Booouse me  But you see I two houses shine I sexy

Becoming real Happy meal I am not your food I don't belong to your aquarium or your plate or your mouth or your teeth or your gullet or your stomach or your intestines or your bowels

When the fat human male with his hair greyish, his face twisted in a state of a sudden, everything matters. He became eel.The man is not shiny. He would end up being on my plate. (It must be very expensive). 

I hear them coming I hear them coming I hear them coming

Along the currents I'm a REAL eel. But once I get to Saragasso I'm shy and I can't die.

PEOPLE UP THERE don't know what it's like to be food. It's great. I am everywhere.

A guide on fleeing the cispool: don't wait for the weather to turn, get to the salt of the Earth. Don't fall into the arms of the rockets and the cryogenic chambers. It's okay to be scared; it's hard to cum, it's hard to stay.


Sexy eels, all the sexy eels I hear them.
I hear them shaking up the waters, the seas, the lakes, the rivers and seas and lakes. Like the lighting effortlessly and with so much grace.
I swim. I’m delicious and sexy.
Ready to ride, ride the currents ride the waves.
I ride.
I’m delicious and sexy.
Sexy eels, all the sexy eels I hear them.
I hear them shaking up the water.
Becoming a non transparent individual is my life.
I might not return, to reproduce, to spawn.
Maybe I don’t want to.
I might sleep for 150 years.
I am not yours to decide.

I am the eel that is glamorous and curvy and the kind that you would die for

Dear water, I am ready to go, to grow. I did not learn being able to survive. I live from this data, from this tiny little cells. Like one of these machines feed with information. Informations others have collected on their path.
