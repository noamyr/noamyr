‘I’ for species am all bodies. 

Do I want to spawn if it means I will die?  

If 'I' am all eels how do I understand 'when' and 'where'?

The salt water coincides with my maturity; the sea is my sex; how does the sea know when I come?

Sea you are so sexy; the idea of merging frightens and attracts. I know it will end here; at the same time I sea myself unborn

I feel serenity in the sea changing from a pool of unlimited intercourse into a sea of innocent transparent leaf-like larvae - its all the same sweet and salt

Having sex in the sargassosea was worth all those years lying in a ditch



あなたの口づけ、ポテトチップみたい。やめられない、止まらない。食べ過ぎないように気をつけようとも思わない。そうゆう思いが浮かび出す余裕もない。何も考えないでただあなたの中へと潜って、潜り続きたい。そんな深く潜って、どこへ行くんだろう。永遠に潜り、永遠に潜り続ける。こことは別の世にたどり着いて、そこに住み着いてあなたのことをを忘れるのかな。別の世にはあなたの味は存在するか。ポテトチップの味だけを思いだし、その思い出が浮かびあるたんび切なく感じて。あなたのことをいずれ忘れるかもしれない。

your kisses are like potato chips, can’t eat just one. gorge myself endlessly, infinite stomach expanding. my infinite stomach cyclones what you give me into a wormhole, storing it away for another universe. pilfering energy from my lining , throwing it away into the canal.

i keep returning to the junction of your thigh and your ass, where you told me to come. i keep retuning there but if my mother or my therapist or my best friend asked me why, i couldn’t explain. the unexplainability gnaws at me. would you call to let me know when you’ll arrive?

なぜそんな顔をするの。悲しいの？嬉しいの？お腹空いてるの？電話して。背中洗って。もう寝る時間だよ。じゃあまた明日ね。おやすみ、sweet dreams.


I've watched too much eel porn and now I forgot how to procreate properly. Eel porn is making me have an unrealistic view of sex. I'm having trouble getting a eel hard-on. 
I writhe as writing: loop and knots and crosses of my inky length. Curling cursive, slinking script. 
Im frustrated with eel science. Eel Freud is calling everything an eel, even penises. Seeweed's an eel, fish are eels with balls. I'm done. Might fuck and die later. 
I am not feeling well today. Should I start this text with I or not? I am confused. Anyhow, there are so many dirty-wet tissues with my snot next to me on my desk with my laptop. My little Covid-19 kit says I am Negative.
I bought the watch before deciding where I'd place it. Messed up big time. It's 15.14, I know that. 
You are amazing, Noam. How many hours did you all sleep last night? I slept quite a lot, although I am sleepy. I often tell my friends that I am mostly hungry and sleepy. Do you? I should read a lot.

None of us really knew where we're headed but somehow we all left anyway trusting the current. Second night I started feeling something new, water felt warmer and I became warmer. Must be the cruising waters I thought.

Dark and warm around, I couldn't really tell where bodies end and space begins. Maybe we're all disembodied, just mouthholes floating around. Electric sparks when we touch. 

Open sea cruising, the tension is high now and pleasure intense. Stakes higher, like some sort of apocalypse is coming. I saw a giant white wale today.

All horned up we swam into the Pacific Trash Vortex and a group of us decided to settle here. All plastic and cocaine residue that we're so grateful to humans for.

I need some chocolates NOW. My partner said my texts were boring. So I told him stop making fun of me/a friend. Haha. I personally don't like some workds, such as girlfriend and boyfriend. We are grown up, so how are we girls and boys?

A friend of mine bought a giant teddy bear from a flea-market today. The colour of the teddy bear is ivory, and the size is as tall as seven drwaves. Has anyone seen seven dwarves?

I have never counted how many AH(Albert Heijn)s are there in my town. Your voice is muted now, and I believe you don't hear my sniffing sound, either.

Supposingly, one day I woke up as an eel bride. I am in a lovely mood, a bit euphoric about the upcoming event. Being a bride means waltz dancing first of all, or at least a small waltz. What would I dress on if I normally prefer avoiding waltz vertigo? I guess that a cute hair garment with a gyroscope mechanism would be okay for me, besides, it is white and fabulous. That is actually perfect for a wedding. If one dances for a long time, especially being an eel, they can easily loose their mind while waltzing. Eventually that makes sense, but it also creates a danger for a yuong eel bride. A bride should always be concentrated, by keeping their head in cool. Having a head is actually my principal trophey, with its ability to think logically and consistently. Yes, it is my advantage of a bride and an absolute opposition to my tail-body.
Therefore my waltz should be a safe waltz, but not one of a kind of a dangerous waltz type. 
The day I could make sure that I was really the bride, and not just made it up, I would make a plan. My plan would not necessarily be a detailed one, or long-termed. Honestly speaking, the main secret of a good plan is the decisiveness of intentions. The more you like your plan, the stronger and more stable your determination becomes. When you have a plan, you would never say that you have no plans or free, besides, the world has always accepted busy people with gratitude. Being not free or even busy, but also having a plan are the main qualities of a bride, of course, if they don`t not change their mind and still want a waltz.

My age is connected to my location. I've always dreamed of dating a younger eel, a teenager preferably. I'm a creelp. Yet migration makes me only able to date eels my same age. I cry sometimes, for eel teenagers.
Ffffoouushhhh... I enter. my skin hardens, intimated. Beautiful bodies swirling seemlsy easy through the ocean, I feel excited, my eyes can't  see the end of like minded individuals morphing into ones. Hesitantly, I join the space, myself as vessel, filled up full desire, nervousness for entering this new chapter of my being.  
Im an eel. Do you like my skin? I eat shrimp flavored gum to impress other eels. To seduce eels I play some background noise on my sexy jukebox and make eye contact. Shimme my curves and say: DangerBox Eel, what's your name? I've practised thousands of times. 
    
    

My body. Left/Right but in a direction. From the start I moved through aquatic and other fluid :} mediums for a time being. Grew, growth, englargment and change for a reason of dissssco(very). But again a time to move. Movement with a new body from linearity of (left/right) to swiggle ~~~~~~~~ time is time and mate is as death awaits. 

Mobility for a time being. being. being. being. being until being becomes becoming and mobility becomes coming home. Weight that I carry with me is about to ex$%$#00). The path I took bacccccccckkkkk ?????? Magnetic pull pulling meeeeeee swiggggglllleeeiiiiy~~~~ to love ~~~a giant cocktail of love. So that I can die and pass on what I have become.

A current away with others. FLuIDs I am fluidds i embody. Born in movment my movement mimics movement beocoming fluid is like fluid. But differs? Differs how maybe I never started and became fluid but was already. To ~~~~~~~~~~~~ swiggle back to foundation ~~~~~~ a calling current to

Rewwwwwweennneeewwwww in wwwwwwwwwattttttter ~~~~~~~~ how doooo doo do I beccceeeoommmmeeee ffffffffluuuuuuuuuuuuuiiiiiiidddddd.Iammmm fluid i always was fluid.

I wriggle to the moon rhythm, but something always stops me short. Do I grow? Or is it shrinking all around me? Others flit past shrouded, translucent. They mean no harm, or they don’t do it on purpose. It’s only me to blame, or the watery walls shrinking as I reach, eternally.

 hello i can not see anything in the darkness of the ocean. it was wet and smelly. I feel sticky and slippery. smooth. slow. slowly i enter into the deeper water.more and more. I am one of everything. I am one of the monsters. 

Deepening, depending, diving, delving, driving, dipping, dripping, slipping our gentle slimes together, slick delicious you and you and you and you and you and I I I I. 

÷×÷×÷×÷×÷×÷×÷×÷×÷×÷× so many of us x÷×÷×÷×÷×÷×÷×÷×÷ so many of us ÷×÷×÷×÷×÷×÷× we divide and multiply 

I love with a supple blend, or a specific serum. Think Love as a sticky float. Think Love as a pool noodle bobbing in the mid-Atlantic, nibbled by the sea. Minty salty stinging love, faceless and impersonal vaseline handshake offered equally to everyone in the line.

Scent gland. Retina camera. Pad of tongue. Swell nerves like seagrass meadow down my flank. A long em dash or a comma of sensation, I slink through current, concurrent with our magnet pull.

Loop and lapse, ellipsing i lose myself, elided blissful into spew and release, out of myself ~~~ ahhh all my I has flowed into you, unknowing unknowing unknowing but come and gone now as it was always known 

Wiggle wriggle on this deep sea dance floor, yes! You have found the place. It nested deep in all our unnamed underparts, waiting to drag and spring and sex and sail us straight to this faraway cold paradise: a kind of secret club standing on the edge of death. 

I need to get used to the sounds now somehow they sound more wet oOooOooOooO 

slowly floating around through the scene, I ease into the spectrum of possibilities, specturem of desires, my body more and more morphs, and passes through other bodies, sometimes linger a moment in apriciation, no longer alien but fitting in

A soft skin touches mine, invites me kindly, consently, my heart beats, I let myself fall into it, attracting more eels to join us, one by one, we feel each other, little words, touch we discover, in the end all gentials fluidly transform into each other, from one another, come together, lips, wholes, strokes, gently press

what is sex. how do we have sex. is there a right way. what would be wrong during sex. am i talking too much about sex. am i talking not enough. i never know. am i who i think i am. am i sex.

look at me. looooooooook at me. i am lost. i love this. i am loving this. can you hear me? looooooooook at me. 

no

fuck fuck fuck fuuuuuuuuuck fuck fuuuuck

this is not going enywhere. i am lost.

help.

I am submissive to the algorithm.

mess me up

is anyone looking at my nonsense? I do not even have any idea of where this is going. my fingers just do their own thing. I think I may be possssed. Who am I? am i the fingers or am I the texts?

what makes a story story? do we need a protagnist. does the protagnist have to die? does the protagnist have to foll in love? why do i expect certain things. it could just be a fish, an eel.

I woke up oneday and I found myself lying on the floor of my bathroom. I saw white tiles reflecting the early sunlight. The golden ring around the mirror. water dripping in the tap, tick tock. I raise up. I look into the mirror. I became a cat.

i always imagine myself a shrimp when I was swimming in the swimming pool. my body becomes half tarnsparent. My legs split up into tentacles. wiggling with the current. I bend over. I spit out the dirt.

I can not feel my vagina anymore. Last time I had something in there it was in the doctor's office. He was my therapist for over five years.

never in my life has I imagined to spread sperms. this is dream come true.

what is true

hypnotize me

eel me, you eelllllingly, eeler, eeling, we flourishy floush, you me us i flllllssshhhh , slingerling slow sloowy floush, ealing sloush me, fuck, I want to fuck. 

How can I keep myself as my body yearns to travel, to feel new among strangers and release itself up to the everything? How do I let lovers inside, when my love needs to leave free? I tangle myself up in knots, and the complexity almost chokes love out.

Watch out! One of my habits is not-reading any messages such as WhatsApp and/or IG. I cannot be bother to answer all the messages and I am not really interested in social media. Social mediaS? Am I having fun?

I didn't choose a colour though, how did you know one of my favourite colours is Orange? Hmm, but it had to be a little brighter. Something reminded me of a small trip to Briton. A bowl of Pho, hot soup, walking at night... How long is the 200 words?

I haven't written anything before this workshop. Well, I had planned to do though. Thanks Noam. I am becoming an eel. I am looking at your 'nonsense' at the moment, but I cheer you up. I cannot be a nonsense. We are doing well.

I was a bit upset this morning for not knowing what way to swim, while I always know exactly what direction and never hesitate.

I like the sun it warms me up and colours my eel body darker like time. Can't wait to die on a high note(-(-_(-_-)_-)-) high and low swimming suits me both well. like worms in the sea and see where she were.  

Boom. I am drifting through the sea. Reconnecting is not an option. I see you and you are floating far away, looking for a spot to lay your eggs. I swiftly float towards the rocks, but, afraid of the moray eel, I rapidly change position. There are many of us out there, it's like a dejavu. Time to hear the music. Thinking rationally takes too much oxigen from my brain, so I focus on happy thoughts. Sometimes I can't hear the music as well as you do. 

Hi I am too when i was standing without legs next to the door that i knew so well and sat so often but i got nervous when i didnt found it funny.

I have died a thousands if not million deaths reincarnated bodies of water in water and well under waiting to repeat until repeated eggs legsless seamen 

I'm a bit confused, because I can't feel my legs. Then I remember, I forgot to put them on this morning. It's time for swimming. I share this big bath with all these bubbles. I'm quite ticklish. My favourite thing in the whole world is swimming upside-down, then I don't see them coming. A bubble suprises me from behind my ear-hole. 

I am eel Tesla, I have invented eelectric cars. Shame there is nowhere to put the chargers... I am eel Armstrong. I am the first eel to land on the moon. Saw some great places to put eelectric chargers. Should probably mail eel Tesla. 

I saw you see standing there leaning your weight onto one limb. Pressure stacks higher. A curled strand tickling your armpit with every move—perfect. Pivoting around each other. I always wanted some of the same things, effortlessly perfect. 

I don't like my name. It feels unfinished and unimportant. I want something with a little bit more weight to it and a title. Like Dr. Blendardeux or Ir. Elexafricious. You choose. 

I am told I am suppposed to go somewhere to die. I don't really feel like dying, so I am (as usual) postponing this task. Instead I found some friends on the shore. They seem friendly. I approach and wiggle around, to impress them. They seem to like it. From now on I will be the dancing eel. 

My skin is very oily these days. As a hydrophobic creature I shoot through the ocean like an underwater bullet. Come and catch me! Feel the grease run through your fingers. I am so fast.  

I adore everybody here all beautiful °º¤ø, forever¸should¸,ø¤º°`e°º¤ø,¸a,ø¤°º¤ø,u¸¸,tø¤º°i`°º¤ø,¸ swimming eels in a pond in de warmoestraat °fº¤ø,¸u¸,ø¤º°`l°º¤ø,¸,ø¤°º¤ø,¸¸,ø¤º°`°º¤ø, love¸

Slosh and slip, overseas and upriver, to warmth and growth and hiding places in the ground. You’ll never find me here, while I soak the life from the bedrock. I squirm the ether into skin, calloused and enclosing me, diamond reborn in the dark.

eelwhite floors and eelgray walls with eelwhite eelgrayish window panes. money goes some places where no places once were lately i was swimming near a lake less sweet and it was as if for the first time i was back in high school School of fish of eels are eels in school and what do we learn 

I awaken from the deepest slumber. I’m wet all over, cool to the touch and strikingly sexy. Too sexy for this place. Too sexy for you. My scales tickled by the light, mmmmmm

I bet I could swim across this landscape. The water, warm like a hug, holds me idle. I can’t drown even though I can touch the bottom. 

How many selves have i got? My identity is elastic, held by the expansive ocean I somersault into a million versions of myself. Smooth, clammy, spiky, grey, dull, horny, bouncy, grainy…what else? 

Squiggle squiggle across the currents of my being 

I just got out from my room and changed my seat to the living room. A few years ago, when I was learning English with a tutor from Wales, she said I needed more practices when it comes to Articles. a/an/the... I didn't listen to her. I was and I am very lazy. ~Cool~ ‰

I get crazy when I hear that sound. That sounds that reminds me of that time. I can't help but go back to make sure that it isn't happening again. Cold sounds of shattering glass — what broke now? Without spine, without limbs, without face, without dry skin. Soft branches relieve my itch, another sound distracts me.

Throw me in and pull me out, if you can hold on. If there is enough of me left. I slide everyways, and you won’t find me there. That’s why you’re left slimy, empty handed in the fog, as the beacons shine across pools of what you missed.

Woah, how can I touch myself? I love touching myself but now I don’t have my hands. Hands? Maybe I do. Maybe I have it as another form than I used to have. How can I find it? How can I feel it? How can I feel my hands? 

What was the sensation of the feelings that I used to have? I don’t remember. Maybe I feel my hands here; or there? I want to smash my body softly to the rock next to me. Wooo, that hurts. Ooh, i feel hurt! That’s exciting. Now I feel, I sense. It doesn’t really matter if my hands are here or not. It feels good.

Upstream followers of conventional habits. Shall I also follow? I'd rather make my own rules but i'm also lazy. I prefer spending my days hanging out in crevices and other places of comfort. I feel that the days are too long but life is short. leap, jump, spin and tumble. Pastimes to fill me. 

Queezy easy fleeting flowing swirming do you think there are more doors or more wheels in the world?

I swim, I flow, I trance. I clash, I knack, I spawn. I go, I breed, I proliferate. I went and turned around. I exist by being other. But what am I without? Hard lines, strong grids and borders. They tend to transform my ought. How I can be plural is wretched by dual thoughts.

My past, my present, my future. Is drown by circular motions. No start, no end, no middle. Only tinkering movements, entangling my being to become. It's love, it's fear, it's anger. Emotions passing through me, a non-existent moment. Just motion through space and time.

Untangle, unstrangle, unstable. No catagories should exist. For me to become identified. This all just does not work. 

Where the fuck am I going? 

Hi. I’m so done with this. Why should I swim swim and swim all the fucking time? Can I just rest? Can I stop thinking but sleep? Let me go  

One day I woke up and I was an eel. Not technically, of course. I think I was still kind of an human. But I could feel my body was way more slippery than usual and I felt an uncontrollable urge to go to the Sargasso Sea to have sex and then die.

I wish I was an eel. They are just as driven by their instincts as us but then they don't question every single fucking thing that they do or that just happens to happen to them. For eels there are no hidden meanings behind anything, they just swim and have eel-fun.

Rub me the wrong way and I'll give you an electric shock. Only in my mind though, on the outside I will be just as cordial as ever. This feels like writing on a journal but in front of strangers. I feel super vulnerable right now. I just want to get along with everyone.

My brothers and sisters around me, coagulating and dissolving into something bigger, something thinner, something else. I drive towards it with everyone at my side, but it is the end of me, and I want so badly to be gone, and to be everywhere, replete.

I was wrong and you were too. Fairness is never really fair you know. I can tell you that my experiences were nothing like yours. You have your story, I have mine. Respond and excuses are not the same. How can i trickle down and stretch out wide? I want to take up more space. I need to find a method of my own that only works for me but i dont want to own anything, otherwise im not free. Untied, untangled.

This voyage is making me feel incredibly aroused.

I’m Darker and more aroused than ever before. 

I just want to explode. Once I’ve exploded, I’ll be able to rest.



Do you want to dance? Flow with me through all my phases. 

I’m starting to hate this place, like a fucking black hole i dont know where I’m going. Lost, confused and overstimulated by the seaweed. All I see is fucking seaweed. 

Slithering, I survive by accident. Oopsy offspring. Death.

Squirming through chat roulette, I find dancing friends
