I am eel
I don’t feel 
Hunger 
When I eat a meal 
I don’t deal 
With the real 
Sex appeal 
Happy eel 
Spinning wheel
Apple pie 
One more lie 
Gently steal 
Tongue of steel 
Find the seal 
Of my heart 
Depart to sea 
Apart from me 
I am eel 
I do feel 
Becoming real 
Happy meal 

I will return, slimy, long, silver, wise and shiny.

It’s hard to cum, it’s hard to stay.

Born in the baltic sea I made my way to the Sargasso Sea. I never got there. I got hooked. Hooked on the east coast of  Scotland. Hooked on the hook of an amateur with a bucket hat sitting on the Tay bridge hooking me. I die after I reproduce. This is my cycle. I never got there. I never die. 

One time I was indistinguishable. Two parts of me as one - breaking binaries through three quarters of my life. Three I reach the spot now I am one or the other of two. Four I return to the soup I came from.  

It’s like walking in and out of the same room and thinking I will die in there. And I will. And that’s why I have to go. I can’t wait to die. Over some other scales, in this pond of massacre. I can’t wait to get out of here, but I’m shitting myself. One day I’ll do it, I will leave the cesspool. 

sexy eels all the sexy eels I hear them coming I hear them shaking up the waters the seas the lakes the rivers and streams, all the sexy eels making sexy currents how wonderful how wonderful and sassy
the noises like SSSSS
or like EEEE
or QWASERF
the kind of noises that only eels can understand
the sexy noises

I am an eel. I swim. I’m delicious and sexy. Humans use me like a dildo but in my life there’s no phallus involved.

It matters what knots knot knots, what eels feel eels. 

When the fat human male
with his hair greyish
his face twisted
in a state of a constant
discomfort
says
"my grandfather worked here with 60 women
my father with 40
I work with none, I do all the work by myself
I am rich
I have two cars and two houses
But you see I would never have any work done
with women like you around"
does he mean that as a disgusting compliment?
or as an offence
I don't know
For I am the eel
Twisting and turning
Slimy and shiny
Glittering and glamorous
Reflecting the sun beautifully
Going through currents
With or against them
The man is not shiny
he reflects nothing
and there's no shine to his skin
I look at him as if he was a species
long gone
but somehow remained on the surface of the Earth
I think to myself:
How interesting,
some species
hang in there against all odds.



I am the eel the shining eel the glamorous eel the eel of long and curvy shape the beautiful eel the gorgeous eel the eel that you would die for the eel that goes through the streams of rivers and seas and lakes like the lighting effortlessly and with so much grace I am the eel you would die for I am the eel the eel the eel that is glamorous and curvy and the kind that you would die for

Dear watery diary
I am excited for the upcoming eel dance
I will spread my information all over and mix it with another information and together we will make new data and who knows what the new data may be.
I live for this data, I am the data and so are the other eel and how fun!
Oh I can't wait for the water to mix it and shake it and make up some eely things I would have never even thought about, why would I anyway.

All of a sudden, everything matters. Still, I’m reluctant to call myself a dyke.


I pass to you the genes, the genes that will tell you how to survive. 
I collected currents, temperatures, depths, all in my skin, my vains, my bones. 
I compressed it so I, who is now you: I, will know. 
Know where to go and how to survive these slippery waters. 
The surgasso flow.
 
I am ready to go, to grow
I hope I know where to go
I am hungry, and a bit warm
I will search for colder waters
ships and containers
currents of commodities
not me
I want to be a glassy eel
Yellow eel
Silver eel
And to be a larva again

I am not your food
I don't belong to your aquarium
or your plate
or your mouth
or your teeth or your gullet
or your stomach
or your intestines
or your bowels
I am not yours
to decide

Becoming a non transparent individual is my life. Not only to be seen by others but in the end act as a silver mirror to look at myself and look back at my life.

eel Booo: wow you know what I heard! I heard from Rooo that there are sapien species called human on the land. The babies have to know exactly who have born them! like, they are able to trace whose sperm has fertilised whose egg… Isn’t that crazy? I mean, how on earth are they able to trace their tiny little cells?  hey Fooo, do you wanna go with me and check out what’s up there? I wanna find out what kind of machine they use for sperm/egg identification! It must be very expensive… 
eel Fooo: something you don’t know about human is that they have something called “bed”.. they have sex there and the bed remembers whose egg is fertilised by whose sperm :))) 

Me, I’m a child. They patronize me because they can’t see me. I’m a little game. And I love looking for the playground.

It was after the day, when I had to stop the journey. It was when I realized that my body was no longer thinker.

Several days passed. But my body still remains translucent. Not getting thicker meant the failure of being a REAL eel. What is the meaning of becoming a REAL eel? Being able to travel? Being able to survive? Being fertile? Being able to reproduce?

Gradually, I was getting invisible to other eels in the herd. The journey continued. As others matured, I become more transparent. The thicker and darker the others bodies, the more immature I became.
