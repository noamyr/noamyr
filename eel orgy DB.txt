hello i can not see anything in the darkness of the teddy bear from a flea-market today. The colour of the ocean. it was wet and smelly. I feel sticky and slippery. smooth. slow. slowly i enter into the mirror. I became a cat.the sea is my sex Genitalia finally arrived. One day shipping was yesterday. disembodied mouthholes floating around my cuddle puddle tentatively I swim under the green bits just skimming them and the feeling i get is right in the middle of malicious and inviting. Do I swim towards it? or do i stop here. taut bands of energy propel me towards you. our inevitable union, our inevitable death.With a crazed look, i make eye contact with myself in the mirror. I don’t smile but i feel like someone has smiled back at me. how have i found myself here in the water-land, when everything i knew and loved, my daily routine, was right there where i came from? it yearns i want to be crushed like a peach against a brick wall, juiced up from the weight of their body concentrated into the heel of their hand. i don’t care if someone or something consumes me afterwards or if i just get left in a puddle right there, the residue from my flesh can cling there if it wants to, that can be my legacy. tomorrow we can find out about whether you and i will have a future. paradoxically, the thing that will give us a future is also the thing that prevents us from our own future. which is more important? to see tomorrow for yourself or to give it to another? およぎながらかんがえてたんだけどさ、わたしたちってなぜこうゆうふうにつくられてるんだろう。かおをあわせずにこづくりって、ちょっとさみしくない？いつかあってみたいな。うなぎパートナーのみなさん、なんぜんにんいるのだろう、なんびゃくまんにんいるのだろう。I want so badly to be everywhere, replete. I was wrong and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and I became warmer. Must be the cruising waters I thought. Dark and warm around, I couldn't really tell where bodies end and space begins. Maybe we're all disembodied, just mouthholes floating around. Electric sparks when we touch. Open sea cruising, the tension is high now and pleasure i
ntense. Stakes higher, like some sort of apocalypse is coming. I just want to explode. Once I’ve exploded, I’ll be able to rest. Do you want to dance? Flow with me through all my phases. I’m starting to hate this place, like a fucking black hole i dont know where I’m going. Lost, confused and overstimulated by the seaweed. All I see is fucking seaweed. Slithering, I survive by accident. Oopsy offspring. Death. Squirming through chat roulette, I find dancing friends 8============D 8=======D 8===========D 8=====D Invisible adolescence waiting to be colorized. Queezy easy fleeting flowing swirming do you think there are more doors or more wheels in the ground. You’ll never find me here, while I soak the life from the bedrock. I squirm the ether into skin, calloused and enclosing me, diamond reborn in the dark. eelwhite floors and eelgray walls with eelwhite eelgrayish window panes. money goes some places where no places once were lately i was swimming near a lake less sweet and it was as if for the first time i was back in high school School of fish of eels are eels in school and what do we have sex. is there a right way. what would be wrong during sex. am i talking too much about sex. am i talking not enough. i never know. 
am i who i think i am. am i sex. look at me. looooooooook at me. i am lost. i love this. i am loving this. can you hear me? looooooooook at me. looooooooook at me. i am lost. i love this. i am loving this. can you hear me? looooooooook at me. looooooooook at me. i am lost. i love this. i am loving this. can you hear me? looooooooook at me. looooooooook at me. i am lost. i love this. i am loving this. can you hear me? looooooooook at me. no fuck fuck fuck fuck fuuuuuuuuuck fuck fuuuuck this is not an option. I see is fucking seaweed. Slithering, I survive by accident. Oopsy offspring. Death. Squirming through chat roulette, I find dancing friends 8============D 8=======D 8===========D 8=====D Invisible adolescence waiting to be colorized. I think I may be possssed. Who am I? am i the fingers or am I without? Hard lines, strong grids and borders. They tend to transform my ought. How I can be plural is wretched by dual thoughts. My past, my present, my future. Is drown by circular motions. No start, no end, no middle. Only tinkering movements, entangling my being to become. It's love, it's fear, it's anger. Emotions passing through me, a non-existent moment. Just motion through space and time. Untangle, unstrangle, unstable. Maybe I feel sticky and slippery. smooth. slow. slowly i enter into the Pacific Trash Vortex and a group of us x÷×÷×÷×÷×÷×÷×÷×÷ so many of us ÷×÷×÷×÷×÷×÷× we divide and multiply I love with a tutor from Wales, she said I needed more practices when it comes to Articles. a/an/the... I didn't listen to her. I was an eel. Not technically, of course. I think I was and I found myself lying on the floor of my bathroom. I saw white tiles reflecting the early sunlight.

 You are an amazing eel-wrangler, Noam. How many eels did you all eat last night? I am one of the WMDs from the flea-market today.

To beel or not to beel? Sexy eel majesty!
Zoom zoom zoom. The underwater world. Nonsense, sparks and cruisin. Hesitantly I grow out. Of place and space in water. I foreclose my own without. So eery, slippery and slithery. Human's science won't grasp my knowing.
Settler being settled. Oh I feel so submissively unsettled. 
Rub me the right way and I'll give you an electric blanket, for the cold nights out at sea and in the caves. As a hydrophobic creature I am terrified of water. Scrimping eels in a saving mood, a bit tentative about overspending at the eel ball.
I exist by being other. But what am I without? Hard lines, strong grids and borders. They tend to transform my ought. Must be the cruising 
waters, I suppose. 
Where the go am I fucking? Hi. I’m so done with this that I surrender myself to the eel mind; take me inside. I speak now with one voice, fuck left and fuck right all at the same time – a colossal wave of f-eeling gooddddd.
A friend of mine bought a giant teddy bear from a flea-market today. The colour of the ocean. it was wet and smelly. I feel that the days are too long but I swim, I flow, I trance.
Instead I found some friends on the moon.
They tend to transform my ought.

I need some chocolates NOW. My partner said my texts were boring.
Days are too short but life is too long.
I want to create danger for my eel-bride!
I just want to take up more space. I want my load to spread far and wide. The currents will choose my lovers. Bake bread with my gametes. Eat my code with your friends and family.
Shoot through the oceans and the stars, oceans of starts, shoot self into nebula cloud of shared swill, cloudy galaxy microcosm code misting the sea 
I am Negative. Dark and warm around, I couldn't really tell where bodies end and space begins. Maybe we're all disembodied, just mouthholes floating around. None of us really knew where we're headed but somehow we all left anyway trusting the current.
If one dances for a spot to lay one's eggs, to get laid, to be laid to rest. If one dances for a seat at the end of the world, if one dances to death throws, throwing shapes, shaping an apocalypse disco in twitch and glide.

BOOM BOOM BOOMM__̴ı̴̴̡̡̡ ̡͌l̡̡̡ ̡͌l̡
Party in the Pacific Trash Vortexxxx!
Having a head is actually my principal party trophey 
I feel super vulnerable right now. I just want to smash my body softly into everything. I want to merge with a giant will and spit water out the the top of my head. 

look at me. looooooooook at me. i am lost. i love this. i am loving this. McDonalds is my granddad. McEel we call him. So I told him stop making fun of me/a friend. 

eelllllingly, eeler, eeling, we flourishy floush, don't flush me down. Keep me as your pet. It's love, it's fear, it's unstable, it's eeliest. 

I love touching myself but now I don’t have my hands. Hands? Can you scratch me please?

Squiggle squiggle across the currents of my being I just got out from my room and changed my seat to the living room. high and low swimming suits me both well. like worms in the sea is my sex; how does the sea know when I come?

Can't wait to die. la lal lala lalala flluuuuuuiiiiii fllllluiiiiii fluiiiiiiiddddd  high left la la lal lalal right raaaw raaaw rawww right like swiggley worms. i live in the sea going no where i am lost. moon guide me dream come true. you eelllllingly, eeler, eeling, we all EEL swiggle togehter in this hot and cold mess messy mess and slouuuushh slushi ealing sloush me, I want to fuck.

My plan would not necessarily be a detailed one, or long-termed. I cry sometimes, for eel teenagers. Ffffoouushhhh... I enter. I've watched too much eel porn and now I forgot how to procreate properly. Eel porn is making me have an unrealistic view of sex.
I'm having trouble getting a eel hard-on. I write as writing: loop and knots and crosses of my inky length. Curling cursive, slinking script. I am frustrated with eel science. Eel Freud is calling everything an eel, even penises. Seeweed is an eel, they can easily loose their mind whilst waltzing. Eventually that makes sense, but it is the end of me, and I want to fuck.
How can I keep myself as vessel, filled up full desire, nervousness for entering this new chapter of my being. I am an eel. Do you like my skin? I eat shrimp flavoured gum to impress other eels. To seduce eels I play some background noise on my sexy jukebox and make eye contact.
Shimme my curves and say: DangerBox Eel, what's your name? I've practised thousands of times. My body. Left/Right but in a direction. From the start I moved through aquatic and other fluid :}
I didn't listen to her. I was still kind of an human. I've always dreamed of dating a younger eel, a teenager preferably. I'm a creelp. Yet migration makes me only able to date eels my same age.
One of my habits is not-reading any messages such as girlfriend and boyfriend.
I just wanna ch-eel. Take it easy... or else.
I want to be old.
I've always dreamed of dating a younger eel, a teenager preferably.
I love touching myself but now I don’t have my hands.
A friend of mine bought a giant teddy bear from a pool of unlimited intercourse.
I cry sometimes, for eel teenagers.
I am told I am supposed to go somewhere to die. I don't really feel like dying.
An unstoppable force meets an unmovable object.
Oopsy offspring.
I cannot feel my vagina anymore.
fuck fuck fuuuuuuuuuck fuck fuuuuck.
Artists and poets as modern day saints.
I ease into the spectrum of possibilities.
my infinite stomach cyclones
Once I’ve exploded, I’ll be able to rest. Do you want to dance?
we divide and multiply with a tutor from Wales
I'm a bit euphoric about the upcoming event
catch and release impossible nonsense. We are so many...i want gravity to define me. dance a small waltz with me, don't be shy now.  
How can I feel my hands? What was the sensation of the teddy bear is ivory, and the size is as tall as seven dwarves. Has anyone seen seven dwarves? I have never counted how many AH(Albert Heijn)s are there in my town. Perhaps seven of them? Or seventeen? Or seventy? Your voice is muted now, and I believe you don't hear my sniffing sound, either. Supposingly, one day I woke up as an eel bride. I felt fancy, smoothy smoothie. It felt delicious, lekker, licorice ice cream. Yummmm! How are you doing my fellow eels?
