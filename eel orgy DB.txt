RNote: Here are some practical tips for my fellow eels in the orgy: 
Each cell can contain a Twitter-length (280 characters) story. 
For more successful reproduction, it’s important to have as many sperms and eggs as possible. Please keep in mind that all the stories should be written in the first-organism perspective with the pronoun ‘I’ because your reproductive cell is a personal reservoir of your bodily stories.
Your stories can be in any written form as long as it doesn’t exceed the character limit: Fiction/Nonfiction, Prose/Poetry, Serious/Nonsensical. Using English is recommended for the ease of communication in the workshop, however, you can use any language and writing system as long as it’s represented in Unicode. Using text in a non-lingual way, such as ASCII art is also possible.
The process of mixing cells will be demonstrated using a simple algorithm called a Markov Chain, a model ‘describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event’. Applied to generative writing, a Markov chain can be used to find the most probable phrase that will come after a specific phrase—in other words, an endless stream of text starting from the first word. Your stories will be shredded and reassembled into hybrid myths, like infant eels emerging from the Sargasso Sea.
Add your story below, and please be careful not to remove what the other eels added.



Your stories start here:
‘I’ for species am all bodies. 

Do I want to spawn if it means I will die?  

If 'I' am all eels how do I understand 'when' and 'where'?

The salt water coincides with my maturity; the sea is my sex; how does the sea know when I come?

Sea you are so sexy; the idea of merging frightens and attracts. I know it will end here; at the same time a sea myself unborn

I've watched too much eel porn and now I forgot how to procreate properly. Eel porn is making me have an unrealistic view of sex. I'm having trouble getting a eel hard-on. 
I writhe as writing: loop and knots and crosses of my inky length. Curling cursive, slinking script. 

I am not feeling well today. Should I start this text with I or not? I am confused. Anyhow, there are so many dirty-wet tissues with my snot next to me on my desk with my laptop. My little Covid-19 kit says I am Negative.

Dark and warm around, I couldn't really tell where bodies end and space begins. Maybe we're all disembodied, just mouthholes floating around. 

None of us really knew where we're headed but somehow we all left anyway trusting the current. Second night I started feeling something new, water felt warmer and I became warmer. Must be the cruising waters I thought.

A friend of mine bought a giant teddy bear from a flea-market today. The colour of the teddy bear is ivory, and the size is as tall as seven drwaves. Has anyone seen seven dwarves?

I have never counted how many AH(Albert Heijn)s are there in my town. Your voice is muted now, and I believe you don't hear my sniffing sound, either.

Supposingly, one day I woke up as an eel bride. I am in a lovely mood, a bit euphoric about the upcoming event. Being a bride means waltz dancing first of all, or at least a small waltz. What would I dress on if I normally prefer avoiding waltz vertigo? I guess that a cute hair garment with a gyroscope mechanism would be okay for me, besides, it is white and fabulous. That is actually perfect for a wedding. If one dances for a long time, especially being an eel, they can easily loose their mind while waltzing. Eventually that makes sense, but it also creates a danger for a yuong eel bride. A bride should always be concentrated, by keeping their head in cool. Having a head is actually my principal trophey, with its ability to think logically and consistently. Yes, it is my advantage of a bride and an absolute opposition to my tail-body.
Therefore my waltz should be a safe waltz, but not one of a kind of a dangerous waltz type. 
The day I could make sure that I was really the bride, and not just made it up, I would make a plan. My plan would not necessarily be a detailed one, or long-termed. Honestly speaking, the main secret of a good plan is the decisiveness of intentions. The more you like your plan, the stronger and more stable your determination becomes. When you have a plan, you will never say that you have no plans, besides, the world has always accepted busy people with gratitude. Being not free or even busy, and also having a plan are the main qualities of a bride, of course, if they didn`t not changed their mind and still want a waltz.

My age is connected to my location. I've always dreamed of dating a younger eel, a teenager preferably. I'm a creelp. Yet migration makes me only able to date eels my same age. I cry sometimes, for eel teenagers.
Ffffoouushhhh... I enter. my skin hardens, intimated. Beautiful bodies swirling seemlsy easy through the ocean, I feel excited, my eyes can't  see the end of like minded individuals morphing into ones. Hesitantly, I join the space, myself as vessel, filled up full desire, nervousness for entering this new chapter of my being.  
Im an eel. Do you like my skin? I eat shrimp flavored gum to impress other eels. To seduce eels I play some background noise on my sexy jukebox and make eye contact. Shimme my curves and say: DangerBox Eel, what's your name? I've practised thousands of times. 
    
    

My body. Left/Right but in a direction. From the start I moved through aquatic and other fluid :} mediums for a time being. Grew, growth, englargment and change for a reason of dissssco(very). But again a time to move. Movement with a new body from linearity of (left/right) to swiggle ~~~~~~~~ time is time and mate is eight death awaits. 

Mobility for a time being. being. being. being. being until being becomes becoming and mobility becomes coming home. Weight that I carry with me is about to explode. The path I took bacccccccckkkkk ?????? Magnetic pull pulling meeeeeee swiggggglllleee~~~~ to love ~~~a giant cocktail of love. So that I can die and pass on what I have become.

A current away with others. FLuIDs I am fluidds i embody. Born in movment my movement mimics movement beocoming fluid is like fluid. But differs differs in con

I wriggle to the moon rhythm, but something always stops me short. Do I grow? Or is it shrinking all around me? Others flit past shrouded, translucent. They mean no harm, or they don’t do it on purpose. It’s only me to blame, or the watery walls shrinking as I reach, eternally.

 hello i can not see anything in the darkness of the ocean. it was wet and smelly. I feel sticky and slippery. smooth. slow. slowly i enter into the deeper water.more and more. I am one of everything. I am one of the monsters. 

Deepening, depending, diving, delving, driving, dipping, dripping, slipping our gentle slimes together, slick delicious you and you and you and you and you and I I I I.

I love with a supple blend, or a specific serum. Think Love as a sticky float. Think Love as a pool noodle bobbing in the mid-Atlantic, nibbled by the sea. Minty salty stinging love, faceless and impersonal vaseline handshake offered equally to everyone in the line.

Scent gland. Retina camera. Pad of tongue. Swell nerves like seagrass meadow down my flank. A long em dash or a comma of sensation, I slink through current, concurrent with our magnet pull.

Wiggle wriggle on this deep sea dance floor, yes! You have found the place. It nested deep in all our unnamed underparts, waiting to drag and spring and sex and sail us straight to this faraway cold paradise: a kind of secret club standing the edge of death. 

slowly floating around through the scene, I ease into the spectrum of possibilities, specturem of desires, my body more and more morphs, and passes through other bodies, sometimes linger a moment in apriciation, no longer alien but fitting in

A soft skin touches mine, invites me kindly, consently, my heart beats, I let myself fall into it, attracting more eels to join us, one by one, we feel each other, little words, touch we discover, in the end all gentials fluidly transform into each other, from one another, come together, lips, wholes, strokes, gently press

what is sex. how do we have sex. is there a right way. what would be wrong during sex. am i talking too much about sex. am i talking not enough. i never know. am i who i think i am. am i sex.

look at me. looooooooook at me. i am lost. i love this. i am loving this. can you hear me? looooooooook at me. 

no

fuck

fuck fuck fuck fuuuuuuuuuck fuck fuuuuck


this is not going enywhere. i am lost.

help.

I am submissive to the algorithm.

mess me up

is anyone looking at my nonsense? I do not even have any idea of where this is going. my fingers just do their own thing. I think I may be possssed. Who am I? am i the fingers or am I the texts?

what makes a story story? do we need a protagnist. does the protagnist have to die? does the protagnist have to foll in love? why do i expect certain things. it could just be a fish, an eel.

I woke up oneday and I found myself lying on the floor of my bathroom. I saw white tiles reflecting the early sunlight. The golden ring around the mirror. water dripping in the tap, tick tock. I raise up. I look into the mirror. I became a cat.

i always imagine myself a shrimp when I was swimming in the swimming pool. my body becomes half tarnsparent. My legs split up into tiny tentacles. wiggling with the current. I bend over. I spit out the dirt.



How can I keep myself as my body yearns to travel, to feel new among strangers and release itself up to the everything? How do I let lovers inside, when my love needs to leave free? I tangle myself up in knots, and the complexity almost chokes love out.

One of my habits is not-reading any messages such as WhatsApp and/or IG. I cannot be bother to answer all the messages and I am not really interested in social media. Social mediaS? Am I having fun?

I didn't choose a colour though, how did you know one of my favourite colours is Orange? Hmm, but it had to be a little brighter. Something reminded me of a small trip to Briton. A bowl of Pho, hot soup, walking at night... How long is the 200 words?

I haven't written anything before this workshop. Well, I had planned to do though. Thanks Noam. I am becoming an eel. I am looking at your 'nonsense' at the moment, but I cheer you up. I cannot be a nonsense. We are doing well.

I was a bit upset this morning for not knowing what way to swim, while I always know exactly what direction and never hesitate.

I like the sun it warms me up and colours my eel body darker like time. Can't wait to die on a high note(-(-_(-_-)_-)-) high and low swimming suits me both well. like worms in the sea and see where she were.  

Boom. I am drifting through the sea. Reconnecting is not an option. I see you and you are floating far away, looking for a spot to lay your eggs. I swiftly float towards the rocks, but, afraid of the moray eel, I rapidly change position. There are many of us out there, it's like a dejavu. Time to hear the music. Thinking rationally takes too much oxigen from my brain, so I focus on happy thoughts. 

Hi I am too when i was standing without legs next to the door that i knew so well and sat so often but i got nervous when i didnt found it funny.

I have died a thousands if not million deaths reincarnated bodies of water in water and well under waiting to repeat until repeated eggs legs and seamen 

I'm a bit confused, because I can't feel my legs. Then I remember, I forgot to put them on this morning. It's time for swimming. I share this big bath with all these bubbles. I'm quite ticklish. My favourite thing in the whole world is swimming upside-down, then I don't see them coming. A bubble suprises me from behind my ear-hole. 

I am eel Tesla, I have invented eelectric cars. Shame there is nowhere to put the chargers... I am eel Armstrong. I am the first eel to land on the moon. Saw some great places to put eelectric chargers. Should probably mail eel Tesla. 

I saw you see standing there leaning your weight onto one limb. Pressure stacks higher. A curled strand tickling your armpit with every move—perfect. Pivoting around each other. I always wanted some of the same things, effortlessly perfect. 

I don't like my name. It feels unfinished and unimportant. I want something with a little bit more weight to it and a title. Like Dr. Blendardeux or Ir. Elexafricious. You choose. 

I am told I am suppposed to go somewhere to die. I don't really feel like dying, so I am (as usual) postponing this task. Instead I found some friends on the shore. They seem friendly. 

eelwhite floors and eelgray walls with eelwhite eelgrayish window panes. money goes some places where no places once were lately i was swimming near a lake less sweet and it was as if for the first time i was back in high school School of fish of eels are eels in school and what do we learn 

I awaken from the deepest slumber. I’m wet all over, cool to the touch and strikingly sexy. Too sexy for this place. Too sexy for you. My scales tickled by the light, mmmmmm

I bet I could swim across this landscape. The water, warm like a hug, holds me idle. I can’t drown even though I can touch the bottom. 

I just got out from my room and changed my seat to the living room. A few years ago, when I was learning English with a tutor from Wales, she said I needed more practices when it comes to Articles. a/an/the... I didn't listen to her. I was and I am very lazy. ~Cool~ ‰



I get crazy when I hear that sound. That sounds that reminds me of that time. I can't help but go back to make sure that it isn't happening again. Cold sounds of shattering glass — what broke now? Without spine, without limbs, without face, without dry skin. Soft branches relieve my itch, another sound distracts me.


Woah, how can I touch myself? I love touching myself but now I don’t have my hands. Hands? Maybe I do. Maybe I have it as another form than I used to have. How can I find it? How can I feel it? How can I feel my hands? 

What was the sensation of the feelings that I used to have? I don’t remember. Maybe I feel my hands here; or there? I want to smash my body softly to the rock next to me. Wooo, that hurts. Ooh, i feel hurt! That’s exciting. Now I feel, I sense. It doesn’t really matter if my hands are here or not. It feels good.

Upstream followers of conventional habits. Shall I also follow? I'd rather make my own rules but i'm also lazy. I prefer spending my days hanging out in crevices and other places of comfort. I feel that the days are too long but 


I swim, I flow, I trance. I clash, I knack, I spawn. I go, I breed, I proliferate. I went and turned around. I exist by being other. But what am I without? 

Hard lines, strong grids and borders. They tend to transform my ought. How I can be plural is wretched by dual thioughts. Indiviplural.
