        <div class="item n"><div><p class="body">Queerlet is a toilet sign that enables users to draw their own human figures based on their gender identity. Queerlet is not only a designed product but also a probe. It functioned as a tool for visual research on people's gender representation and symbolization by collecting an extensive amount of gender-symbols drawn by people from various background.</p></div></div>

        <div class="item n"><div><p class="body">Binary toilet separation doesn’t only dictate the people using it, but also the environment of the toilet. If so, what would be the environment of the non-binary toilets that are defined by the drawing on Queerlets? In order to answer that question, I came up with a fictional toilet that deconstructs and reconstructs the toilet environment that is coded within the binary toilet signs. I created a computer program to demonstrate how this speculative technology works. It obtains parameters of public/private, visible/ invisible, decent/obscene, man/woman, penis/vagina, standing up/sitting, occupied/busy from the drawings, and constructs a new toilet floorplan regarding it. The participants of the workshop could use this program to materialize their gender symbols into bathroom environments. Most of the time, the bathrooms that are generated look very absurd. By conflicting with the stereotypical toilet environment, which is a product of gender binarism, it opens space for viewers to raise questions about the toilet in their daily lives.</p></div></div>

        <div class="item w"><div><p class="body">Queerlets were presented during Qtopia Queer Art Festival Nijmegen 2019. Fifty pieces of Queerlet was installed on every toilet door in the exhibition venues. The aim of this part of the project is to create a database of highly-personal non-binary symbols of gender identity that can hopefully deconstruct and overthrow the obviousness of binary gender symbols. To enlarge the collection, I facilitated a few drawing workshops in several different contexts, including Queer Bookclub at Van Abbe museum. People were asked to draw their own gender symbols, and they could feed their creation into the digital algorithm that I created.</p></div></div>
